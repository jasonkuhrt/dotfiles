{"id":"dotfiles-54h","title":"QA refactor pass: lint, type checks, CI hooks, and code quality for shan","description":"## Summary\n\nComprehensive quality pass on `packages/shan/` to establish a proper check pipeline, eliminate duplication, and wire checks into CC's workflow for automated enforcement.\n\n## Context\n\nShan has grown from a single transcript dump command to a multi-namespace CLI (transcript + task) with 11 source files and no automated quality checks. Several patterns were copied-then-modified during feature work, creating duplicated logic and inconsistent approaches.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### 1. Check Scripts in package.json\n\nAdd scripts to `packages/shan/package.json`:\n\n- `typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`\n- `lint` — biome or dprint (match dotfiles conventions)\n- `check` — runs all checks (typecheck + lint)\n\n### 2. CC Integration Hooks\n\nWire checks into Claude Code's workflow so they run automatically when working on shan:\n\n- Add `packages/shan/.claude/settings.json` (or project-level hooks) with PreCommit or PostToolUse hooks that run `bun run check` on relevant file changes\n- Consider a `.claude/rules/` file scoping shan-specific conventions (Effect patterns, Bun APIs, etc.)\n\n### 3. Deduplicate Shared Logic\n\nSeveral modules duplicate core concepts:\n\n- **Project directory encoding** — `toClaudeProjectDir` in `session-picker.ts` and inline `cwd.replace(/[/.]/g, \"-\")` in `task-resolver.ts`. Extract to a shared `claude-paths.ts` module.\n- **Current session ID** — `getCurrentSessionId()` exists in both `session-resolver.ts` and `task-resolver.ts` with identical implementations. Extract to shared module.\n- **Session discovery for project scoping** — `discoverSessions()` in `session-picker.ts` and `getProjectSessionIds()` in `task-resolver.ts` both scan `~/.claude/projects/\u003cdir\u003e/` with different return types. Unify the underlying scan logic.\n\n### 4. Consistent Effect Patterns\n\n- Some helpers use raw `async/await` (`discoverSessions`, `loadTasks`, `findSessionFile`) while command-level code uses `Effect.gen`. Decide on the boundary: raw async for pure I/O helpers is fine, but document the convention.\n- Error handling mixes `try/catch` (in async helpers) with `Effect.fail` (in generators). This is acceptable but should be explicit/documented.\n\n### 5. Type Safety Cleanup\n\n- `task-picker.ts` has an `as any` cast for Clack's `select` options due to `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` strictness. Investigate if there's a cleaner workaround (Clack type augmentation or explicit option type).\n- `transcript/dump.ts` uses `as` casts for entry type narrowing (lines 37, 66-67, 71). Could use proper Schema refinements.\n\n### 6. Package Exports\n\n`package.json` exports only `./transcript-schema`. Consider adding:\n- `./task-schema` — for external consumers of task types\n- Or decide exports aren't needed and document that decision\n\n### 7. Formatter Setup\n\nNo formatter is configured. Add dprint or biome config consistent with the broader dotfiles repo. Check if the root repo already has a formatter config that should be extended.\n\n## Key Patterns to Preserve\n\n- Effect monad for all command-level composition and error handling\n- `@clack/prompts` for interactive TUI\n- Bun-native APIs (Glob, Bun.file, Bun.spawn)\n- `#!/usr/bin/env bun` shebang for direct TS execution\n- KNUTH LITERAL style (public API first, helpers last)\n\n## Out of Scope\n\n- Tests (separate issue — shan is a CLI tool where manual testing is primary)\n- New features","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jasonkuhrt@me.com","created_at":"2026-01-27T16:31:34.700669-05:00","created_by":"Jason Kuhrt","updated_at":"2026-01-27T16:31:34.700669-05:00"}
{"id":"dotfiles-5cr","title":"Linear skill: replace MCPs with user-level skill + Bun TS scripts","description":"Replace all Linear MCP integrations and fragmented project-level skills with a single user-level skill backed by Bun TS scripts calling Linear's GraphQL API directly.\n\n## Context\n\nAudit found 3 problems:\n1. Two Linear MCPs configured in HB (StreamLinear + official plugin) — competing, confusing\n2. Three HB-level skills for one service (managing-linear-issues, current-linear-issue, uploading-to-linear) — fragmented\n3. Project-specific data (team members, UUIDs) hardcoded in skill prose instead of config\n\nStreamLinear's entire value is ~550 lines wrapping `fetch` to one GraphQL endpoint. No need for an MCP process, npx cold-start, or external dependency. Bun TS scripts do the same thing with zero deps.\n\nOfficial Linear MCP is closed-source, no public repo, no visible roadmap. Dead end.\n\n## Scope\n\nSpans dotfiles repo + all HB checkouts/worktrees (one-time migration).\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### 1. Create user-level skill (`~/.claude/skills/linear/`)\n\n- `SKILL.md` — unified skill with progressive disclosure\n  - Workflows: mention syntax (URL not @username), search-before-create, upload-then-embed\n  - Issue context resolution (branch → context file → search → ask)\n  - Reads project-level config for workspace-specific data\n  - References scripts for operations\n- Scripts (`scripts/`):\n  - `_linear.ts` — shared core: GraphQL fetch wrapper, ID resolution, state matching, formatters (rip from StreamLinear's linear-core.ts)\n  - `linear-search.ts` — search issues\n  - `linear-get.ts` — get issue details\n  - `linear-create.ts` — create issue\n  - `linear-comment.ts` — post comment\n  - `linear-fetch.ts` — download issue + attachments (HTTP binary, not GraphQL)\n  - `linear-upload.ts` — upload file for embed URL (HTTP binary)\n  - `linear-attach.ts` — upload file as issue attachment (HTTP binary)\n  - Or: consolidate CRUD into one `linear.ts \u003caction\u003e` entry point, keep file ops separate\n\n### 2. Design credential resolution\n\nOptions to spec out:\n- `LINEAR_API_TOKEN` env var (current, works)\n- `.env` file loading in scripts\n- `--token-cmd` pattern for 1Password / secrets managers\n- Should the skill document all three? Which is default?\n\n### 3. Design project-level config\n\n- `.claude/linear.yaml` — workspace slug, teams (name → UUID), members (name, displayName, UUID, role)\n- Checked into git (shared team knowledge) vs gitignored vs checked-in + .local override\n- Skill reads this at invocation time\n\n### 4. Remove from HB (all checkouts/worktrees)\n\n- Delete `.mcp.json` `linear` entry (StreamLinear)\n- Remove official Linear plugin from marketplace config\n- Clean `settings.json` / `settings.local.json` / `settings.local.json.example` — remove `mcp__linear`, `mcp__linear__linear` permissions\n- Delete `managing-linear-issues/` skill\n- Delete `current-linear-issue/` skill\n- Delete `uploading-to-linear/` skill\n- Create `.claude/linear.yaml` with HB's team data\n- Update CLAUDE.md reference from `managing-linear-issues` skill to `linear` skill\n\n## Design Decisions to Make\n\n1. Script granularity: one `linear.ts \u003caction\u003e` entry point vs multiple scripts vs shared core + thin entry points\n2. Config format: YAML vs JSON vs TOML\n3. Config git policy: checked in vs gitignored vs split\n4. Credential resolution: env var only vs multi-source\n5.

{"id":"dotfiles-i83","title":"Build meta-skill: D2-driven skill authoring","description":"## Problem\n\nDesigning and maintaining complex skills (like git-sync) is manual layout work. You decide what's inline, what's in references, how to structure progressive disclosure, which format to use. These are repeatable decisions that should be derivable from a flow spec.\n\n## Core Insight\n\nProcedural logic is fundamentally a directed graph. Lists are linearizations. D2 expresses the graph directly — making it the natural **design format** for flow-based skills.\n\nLLMs execute best from sequential prose with conditionals — making linearized formats (speclist, markdown) the natural **execution format**.\n\nThese are different jobs. A meta-skill bridges them: reads D2 design intent, produces whatever skill layout CC will execute most reliably from.\n\n## What the Meta-Skill Does\n\n**Input:** A `.d2` file specifying flow intent (nodes, edges, containers, markdown block strings with tables/code/notes)\n\n**Output:** An optimal skill layout — file structure, format choices, progressive disclosure — that CC will execute reliably from.\n\n### Operations\n\n1. **Greenfield** — Generate a new skill from a D2 spec\n2. **Brownfield** — Update an existing skill after D2 spec changes (targeted edits, not full regeneration)\n3. **Validation** — Check that a skill's implementation aligns with its D2 spec, report drift\n\n## D2 as Spec Format\n\nD2 block strings make it expressive enough for skill specs:\n- `|md ... |` — markdown (headers, lists, bold)\n- `||md ... ||` — markdown with tables (double-pipe escapes inner pipes)\n- `|sh ... |` — shell commands with syntax highlighting\n- `|`md ... `|` — alternative delimiter for complex content\n- Container names = operation/procedure names\n- Diamond shapes = decision points\n- Edge labels = conditions\n- Terminal nodes = HALT / END exit points\n- Comments (#) = context not in the flow\n\nD2 source text (not rendered ASCII/SVG) is what agents read. ASCII rendering drops all rich content to empty boxes.\n\n## What We Don't Know Yet\n\nLayout decisions (progressive disclosure, file splitting, format selection, inline vs extracted content) need to be driven by **semantic meaning** — not by graph shape metrics like node count or nesting depth. The right heuristics are unknown and must be discovered empirically.\n\n**The writing-skills TDD principle applies:** Do this workflow manually 2-3 times before encoding as a skill. Each manual iteration should surface what layout decisions were made and WHY — building the heuristic vocabulary.\n\n### Suggested manual iterations\n1. Take git-sync's existing `reference/flow.d2` and try generating SKILL.md from it — note every decision and gap\n2. Design a NEW skill in D2 first, then produce the skill layout — note what D2 couldn't express and what layout choices felt obvious vs. ambiguous\n3. Edit the D2 for an existing skill and try brownfield sync — note where targeted edits worked and where full regeneration was needed\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- D2 skill (syntax, rendering, docs access via `gh api` against `terrastruct/d2-docs`)\n- speclist skill (flow format syntax — used when warranted, not always)\n- writing-skills (token budgets, CSO, anti-patterns, quality criteria)\n- writing-compact (formatting rules when compressing)\n\n## Prior Art\n\n- git-sync: complex flow-based skill (8 Plan steps, 6 Execute steps, 5 Procedures) — analyzed as test case\n- git-sync now has `reference/flow.d2` as a companion visual reference — candidate for first manual iteration\n- d2lang.com blocks automated fetches (403); use `gh api repos/terrastruct/d2-docs/contents/docs/tour/\u003cpage\u003e.md --jq '.content' | base64 -d` for docs","notes":"## Goal\n\nA validated design for the meta-skill, produced through manual iterations. **Done** means:\n\n1. 2-3 manual iterations completed (D2 → skill layout, each documenting decisions made and why)\n2. Heuristics for layout decisions discovered and documented (what drives format selection, progressive disclosure, file splitting — based on semantic meaning, not graph shape)\n3. A design doc describing the meta-skill's operations, inputs, outputs, and decision heuristics — ready to be encoded as a SKILL.md in a follow-up bead\n\n**Not in scope:** Building the actual skill. That's a follow-up after the design is validated.\n\n## Completed\n\nAll 3 iterations completed. Design doc written to `claude/skills/d2-skill-authoring/d2-skill-authoring.md`.\n\nIteration evidence in `claude/skills/d2-skill-authoring/reference/`:\n- `iteration-1-greenfield-git-sync.md` — Generated SKILL.md from git-sync's flow.d2\n- `iteration-2-d2-first-pr-ship.md` — Designed new pr-ship skill D2-first\n- `iteration-3-brownfield-sync.md` — Targeted edits after D2 modification\n\n### Key Discoveries\n1. D2 captures ~50% of skill info; enrichment gaps are predictable by node type\n2. Layout decisions are mostly mechanical (D2 structure → SKILL.md format)\n3. The hard part is enrichment, not layout\n4. Brownfield sync works for structural edits; topological edits need full regeneration\n5.

Currently no way to browse/read them outside a CC session without manually `cat`-ing JSON files. Need a quick CLI for the human side.\n\n## Operations\n\n### `tl open [target]`\n\nOpen task JSON in editor.\n\n- **Target:** task number OR fuzzy match on subject\n- **Editor:** Use `$EDITOR` if set. If `$EDITOR=nvim`, open in terminal. If `zed`, opens as tab.\n- **List selection:** If `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID` is set, use that. Otherwise, prompt or use most recently modified list dir.\n- **No target:** show picker (list all tasks, select one)\n\n### `tl dump [target]`\n\nDump formatted task to stdout (or to tmp file for piping).\n\n- **Target:** same as `open` — number or fuzzy match\n- **Output:** Human-readable formatted markdown, not raw JSON\n- **No target:** dump all tasks as formatted table (id, status, subject, blocked-by)\n- **Format:**\n  ```\n  # Task 4: Generate Playwright specs from D2 flows\n  Status: pending\n  Blocked by: #2, #3\n  \n  [full description]\n  ```\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n- **Bun CLI** — matches `shan` pattern in `packages/shan/`\n- **Package:** `packages/tl/` with `bin: { \"tl\": \"./src/bin/tl.ts\" }`\n- **Global availability:** Symlink into PATH via dotfiles sync (e.g. `ln -s $(pwd)/packages/tl/src/bin/tl.ts ~/.local/bin/tl` or add packages/tl to Brewfile as local formula)\n- **Task list discovery:** Read `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID` env var → `~/.claude/tasks/$id/`. Fallback: list dirs in `~/.claude/tasks/`, pick most recently modified (or prompt).\n- **Fuzzy match:** Simple substring on subject field.
