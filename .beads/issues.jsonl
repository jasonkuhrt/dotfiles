{"id":"dotfiles-i83","title":"Build meta-skill: D2-driven skill authoring","description":"## Problem\n\nDesigning and maintaining complex skills (like git-sync) is manual layout work. You decide what's inline, what's in references, how to structure progressive disclosure, which format to use. These are repeatable decisions that should be derivable from a flow spec.\n\n## Core Insight\n\nProcedural logic is fundamentally a directed graph. Lists are linearizations. D2 expresses the graph directly — making it the natural **design format** for flow-based skills.\n\nLLMs execute best from sequential prose with conditionals — making linearized formats (speclist, markdown) the natural **execution format**.\n\nThese are different jobs. A meta-skill bridges them: reads D2 design intent, produces whatever skill layout CC will execute most reliably from.\n\n## What the Meta-Skill Does\n\n**Input:** A `.d2` file specifying flow intent (nodes, edges, containers, markdown block strings with tables/code/notes)\n\n**Output:** An optimal skill layout — file structure, format choices, progressive disclosure — that CC will execute reliably from.\n\n### Operations\n\n1. **Greenfield** — Generate a new skill from a D2 spec\n2. **Brownfield** — Update an existing skill after D2 spec changes (targeted edits, not full regeneration)\n3. **Validation** — Check that a skill's implementation aligns with its D2 spec, report drift\n\n## D2 as Spec Format\n\nD2 block strings make it expressive enough for skill specs:\n- `|md ... |` — markdown (headers, lists, bold)\n- `||md ... ||` — markdown with tables (double-pipe escapes inner pipes)\n- `|sh ... |` — shell commands with syntax highlighting\n- `|`md ... `|` — alternative delimiter for complex content\n- Container names = operation/procedure names\n- Diamond shapes = decision points\n- Edge labels = conditions\n- Terminal nodes = HALT / END exit points\n- Comments (#) = context not in the flow\n\nD2 source text (not rendered ASCII/SVG) is what agents read. ASCII rendering drops all rich content to empty boxes.\n\n## What We Don't Know Yet\n\nLayout decisions (progressive disclosure, file splitting, format selection, inline vs extracted content) need to be driven by **semantic meaning** — not by graph shape metrics like node count or nesting depth. The right heuristics are unknown and must be discovered empirically.\n\n**The writing-skills TDD principle applies:** Do this workflow manually 2-3 times before encoding as a skill. Each manual iteration should surface what layout decisions were made and WHY — building the heuristic vocabulary.\n\n### Suggested manual iterations\n1. Take git-sync's existing `reference/flow.d2` and try generating SKILL.md from it — note every decision and gap\n2. Design a NEW skill in D2 first, then produce the skill layout — note what D2 couldn't express and what layout choices felt obvious vs. ambiguous\n3. Edit the D2 for an existing skill and try brownfield sync — note where targeted edits worked and where full regeneration was needed\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- D2 skill (syntax, rendering, docs access via `gh api` against `terrastruct/d2-docs`)\n- speclist skill (flow format syntax — used when warranted, not always)\n- writing-skills (token budgets, CSO, anti-patterns, quality criteria)\n- writing-compact (formatting rules when compressing)\n\n## Prior Art\n\n- git-sync: complex flow-based skill (8 Plan steps, 6 Execute steps, 5 Procedures) — analyzed as test case\n- git-sync now has `reference/flow.d2` as a companion visual reference — candidate for first manual iteration\n- d2lang.com blocks automated fetches (403); use `gh api repos/terrastruct/d2-docs/contents/docs/tour/\u003cpage\u003e.md --jq '.content' | base64 -d` for docs","notes":"## Goal\n\nA validated design for the meta-skill, produced through manual iterations. **Done** means:\n\n1. 2-3 manual iterations completed (D2 → skill layout, each documenting decisions made and why)\n2. Heuristics for layout decisions discovered and documented (what drives format selection, progressive disclosure, file splitting — based on semantic meaning, not graph shape)\n3. A design doc describing the meta-skill's operations, inputs, outputs, and decision heuristics — ready to be encoded as a SKILL.md in a follow-up bead\n\n**Not in scope:** Building the actual skill. That's a follow-up after the design is validated.\n\n## Completed\n\nAll 3 iterations completed. Design doc written to `claude/skills/d2-skill-authoring/d2-skill-authoring.md`.\n\nIteration evidence in `claude/skills/d2-skill-authoring/reference/`:\n- `iteration-1-greenfield-git-sync.md` — Generated SKILL.md from git-sync's flow.d2\n- `iteration-2-d2-first-pr-ship.md` — Designed new pr-ship skill D2-first\n- `iteration-3-brownfield-sync.md` — Targeted edits after D2 modification\n\n### Key Discoveries\n1. D2 captures ~50% of skill info; enrichment gaps are predictable by node type\n2. Layout decisions are mostly mechanical (D2 structure → SKILL.md format)\n3. The hard part is enrichment, not layout\n4. Brownfield sync works for structural edits; topological edits need full regeneration\n5. Semantic signals (not graph shape metrics) should drive support file decisions","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"jasonkuhrt@me.com","created_at":"2026-01-27T10:25:05.704533-05:00","created_by":"Jason Kuhrt","updated_at":"2026-01-27T12:45:24.142149-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-27T12:45:24.142149-05:00","close_reason":"All 3 manual iterations completed.
