## Git Dashboard

When modifying the git dashboard (`fish/config.fish` functions `_git_*`):

- After any visible change (interface, experience, behavior), update `fish/GIT_DASHBOARD_DESIGN.md`
- Keep the design doc in sync with the implementation
- Document new modes, visual changes, or behavior changes
