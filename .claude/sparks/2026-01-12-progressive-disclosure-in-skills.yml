captured: 2026-01-12
context: Reviewing dprint skill, noticed reviewing-skills and writing-skills lack explicit progressive disclosure principle

idea: |
  The superpowers:writing-skills skill implicitly follows progressive disclosure (Overview first,
  details later) but doesn't teach it as a design principle. Gap: skill authors might put critical
  "do this" information after lengthy "why" explanations, forcing agents to read everything.

  Missing guidance:
  - Frontload the 80% use case in first 50 words
  - Structure so agents can stop reading early once they have what they need
  - "Lead with action, defer explanation" pattern
  - Why the SKILL.md structure order matters (not just what it is)

  Research needed: Look into existing literature on optimal design patterns for main file vs
  separate files brought in incrementally. How do documentation systems, man pages, or other
  agent-facing docs handle progressive disclosure? What's the cognitive load research say about
  chunking and layered information?

  Could be upstream PR to superpowers-marketplace or local supplement.
