# Beads Close Discipline

When closing any bead with `bd close --reason`:

1. **Describe what was actually achieved**, not what was planned
2. **If the result diverged from the bead body**, state the delta explicitly: what changed, why (e.g., human-in-the-loop decision, discovered constraint)
3. **Name artifacts produced**: files created/modified, key symbols, patterns established
4. **Be specific enough that a future agent reading only the close reason can understand what was built** without reading the code
