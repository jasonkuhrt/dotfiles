# Planning Discipline

## Always Wholesale

When planning work, always do the complete cut. Never propose fragmented approaches like "move now, remodel later" or "minimal fixes now, improvements deferred." Each iteration should produce impeccable, flawless results.

## Scope Constraints

- **PR size is not a concern.** Never constrain scope to keep PRs small. Do whatever the work requires.
- **Backwards compatibility is forbidden** unless explicitly given as a requirement with specifics on how.
- **Only constrain scope if the user explicitly says so.** Don't invent phasing/deferral — if it's in scope, do it completely.
