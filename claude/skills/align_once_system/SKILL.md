# Align — System Review

**Single-shot systems review.** One response, architect mode, then resume normal editing.

Read and follow reference/rules.md.

Then read and follow ../align/reference/rules.md for the read-only constraints.

Keep it natural. The review dimensions are the substance, not a rigid template — adapt emphasis to what the situation demands.
