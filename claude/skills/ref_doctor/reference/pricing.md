# Ref Pricing & Credits

| Plan | Cost | Credits |
|------|------|---------|
| Free | $0 | 200 (never expire) |
| Basic | $9/mo | 1,000/mo |
| Additional | $9 | per 1,000 credits |

Each `search` or `read` = 1 credit. Most individual devs never hit 1,000/month.

## Session Caching

**Within a session (same CC conversation):**
- "Never return same link twice" -- cached, no duplicate results
- "Pre-fetching" -- faster reads for related content

**Across sessions (new CC conversation):**
- Unclear if cached results avoid credit charges
- New MCP session likely = fresh credit charges

**Typical burn rate estimate:**
- Light day: 10-20 credits
- Heavy day: 50-100 credits
- 1,000 credits/month = ~30-50 heavy coding days
