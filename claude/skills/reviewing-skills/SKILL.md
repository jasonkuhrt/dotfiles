# Reviewing Skills

## CRITICAL

**You MUST apply the referenced skills as if their ENTIRE content was inlined here.** Invoking is not enough. Every checklist item, every anti-pattern, every guideline in those skills applies to your review. A shallow review that misses structural issues covered by the referenced skills is a failure.

Specifically:
- Apply ALL token efficiency checks (redundancy, duplicate content, tutorial vs reference style)
- Check EVERY anti-pattern listed
- Verify ALL structural requirements
- Audit for bloat: "Why X" justification sections, repeated information across sections, decorative content

## Process

Invoke both and exhaustively apply their guidance:

1. `superpowers:writing-skills` - Structure, CSO, token efficiency, anti-patterns, quality criteria
2. `superpowers-developing-for-claude-code:working-with-claude-code` - Official CC skill format, capabilities
