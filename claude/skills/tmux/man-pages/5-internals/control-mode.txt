CONTROL MODE
     tmux offers a textual interface called control mode.  This allows
     applications to communicate with tmux using a simple text-only protocol.

     In control mode, a client sends tmux commands or command sequences
     terminated by newlines on standard input.	Each command will produce one
     block of output on standard output.  An output block consists of a %begin
     line followed by the output (which may be empty).	The output block ends
     with a %end or %error.  %begin and matching %end or %error have three
     arguments: an integer time (as seconds from epoch), command number and
     flags (currently not used).  For example:

	   %begin 1363006971 2 1
	   0: ksh* (1 panes) [80x24] [layout b25f,80x24,0,0,2] @2 (active)
	   %end 1363006971 2 1

     The refresh-client -C command may be used to set the size of a client in
     control mode.

     In control mode, tmux outputs notifications.  A notification will never
     occur inside an output block.

     The following notifications are defined:

     %client-detached client
	     The client has detached.

     %client-session-changed client session-id name
	     The client is now attached to the session with ID session-id,
	     which is named name.

     %config-error error
	     An error has happened in a configuration file.

     %continue pane-id
	     The pane has been continued after being paused (if the
	     pause-after flag is set, see refresh-client -A).

     %exit [reason]
	     The tmux client is exiting immediately, either because it is not
	     attached to any session or an error occurred.  If present, reason
	     describes why the client exited.

     %extended-output pane-id age ... : value
	     New form of %output sent when the pause-after flag is set.  age
	     is the time in milliseconds for which tmux had buffered the
	     output before it was sent.  Any subsequent arguments up until a
	     single ‘:’ are for future use and should be ignored.

     %layout-change window-id window-layout window-visible-layout window-flags
	     The layout of a window with ID window-id changed.	The new layout
	     is window-layout.	The window's visible layout is
	     window-visible-layout and the window flags are window-flags.

     %message message
	     A message sent with the display-message command.

     %output pane-id value
	     A window pane produced output.  value escapes non-printable
	     characters and backslash as octal \xxx.

     %pane-mode-changed pane-id
	     The pane with ID pane-id has changed mode.

     %paste-buffer-changed name
	     Paste buffer name has been changed.

     %paste-buffer-deleted name
	     Paste buffer name has been deleted.

     %pause pane-id
	     The pane has been paused (if the pause-after flag is set).

     %session-changed session-id name
	     The client is now attached to the session with ID session-id,
	     which is named name.

     %session-renamed name
	     The current session was renamed to name.

     %session-window-changed session-id window-id
	     The session with ID session-id changed its active window to the
	     window with ID window-id.

     %sessions-changed
	     A session was created or destroyed.

     %subscription-changed name session-id window-id window-index pane-id ...
	     : value
	     The value of the format associated with subscription name has
	     changed to value.	See refresh-client -B.	Any arguments after
	     pane-id up until a single ‘:’ are for future use and should be
	     ignored.

     %unlinked-window-add window-id
	     The window with ID window-id was created but is not linked to the
	     current session.

     %unlinked-window-close window-id
	     The window with ID window-id, which is not linked to the current
	     session, was closed.

     %unlinked-window-renamed window-id
	     The window with ID window-id, which is not linked to the current
	     session, was renamed.

     %window-add window-id
	     The window with ID window-id was linked to the current session.

     %window-close window-id
	     The window with ID window-id closed.

     %window-pane-changed window-id pane-id
	     The active pane in the window with ID window-id changed to the
	     pane with ID pane-id.

     %window-renamed window-id name
	     The window with ID window-id was renamed to name.
