# JSDoc Limitations

## Variable Hover Doesn't Show Type JSDoc

When hovering over a variable, IDEs show the type but NOT the JSDoc from the type's interface. This is [intentional TypeScript behavior](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/37876).

```typescript
/** Player controls. */
interface AudioPlayer {
  /** Whether playing. */
  isPlaying: boolean
}

const player: AudioPlayer = { isPlaying: false }

// Hovering on `player` -> shows type only, NO JSDoc
// Hovering on `player.isPlaying` -> shows "Whether playing."
// Hovering on `AudioPlayer` -> shows "Player controls."
```

__What works:__

* Hover on type name -> shows type's JSDoc
* Hover on property access -> shows property's JSDoc
* Hover on function call -> shows function's JSDoc

__What doesn't work:__

* Hover on variable -> only shows type signature, never type's JSDoc

__No workaround__ exists besides adding JSDoc directly to each variable declaration, which violates DRY.
