idea: |
  Investigate adding audio feedback to Claude Code workflows using
  https://github.com/shanraisshan/claude-code-voice-hooks

  Potential use cases:
  - Sound on hook events (tool start/complete)
  - Different sounds for success vs error
  - Audio cues for long-running operations completing
  - Ambient awareness without watching terminal
