title: Debug skill auto-approve hook not working
captured: 2026-01-22
context: Capturing sparks when prompted to approve capture-spark skill despite having auto-approve hook
session: ~/.claude/projects/-Users-jasonkuhrt-projects-heartbeat-chat-Heartbeat--worktrees-feat-HEA-3751-tsgo-spike/946af728-0ef0-46e9-9648-4b7bf9317ac8.jsonl
idea: |
  The PreToolUse hook that should auto-approve skills is not working. Still being prompted:

  ```
  Use skill "capture-spark"?
  Claude may use instructions, code, or files from this Skill.
  ...
  Do you want to proceed?
  ```

  Need to investigate:
  - Is the hook configured correctly?
  - Is it firing but returning wrong value?
  - Is there a scope/path issue with worktrees?
  - Does the hook output format match what CC expects?
revisit: "fast-follow: before next session so we don't keep getting interrupted"
