title: Stripe Discord support automation skill
captured: 2026-01-23

idea: |
  Create a skill that automates posting support questions to Stripe Discord from CC sessions.

  The form has structured fields:
  - Your Question (required)
  - Related Request ID(s) (required) - req_... IDs from dashboard
  - What have you already attempted? (required)
  - What are you working on?

  Skill would:
  1. Gather context from current research/conversation
  2. Format question for the structured form
  3. Open browser to Discord with pre-filled content (if possible) or clipboard
  4. Track pending questions and remind to check for responses

  Could generalize to other vendor Discord support channels with similar patterns.
