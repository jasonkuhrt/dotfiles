# Commit Before Commenting

**Never post PR comments, issue comments, or any public-facing messages that describe code changes before those changes are committed and pushed.**

A comment claiming "X is now Y in the code" while the commit hasn't landed means the comment is false when the reviewer reads it. This erodes trust.

## Rule

1. Write the code
2. Commit and push
3. **Then** post the comment describing it

Never reverse steps 2 and 3.
