# Research

## Before Asking the User

Check their dotfiles, codebase (`package.json`, `go.mod`, etc.), Brewfile, and existing configs first. Only ask questions that can't be answered by reading files.

## Library/API Documentation

Use Ref MCP: search with `ref_search_documentation` (full sentence query), read selectively with `ref_read_url`, iterate. Don't bulk-load docs.

## When Ref Isn't Enough

Clone to `~/repo-references/<name>/` and read the actual source code. Web search and docs are starting points — source code is the truth.
