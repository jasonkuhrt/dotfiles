# Screenshots

All screenshots at `~/Pictures/Screenshots/`. CleanShot X files: `CleanShot YYYY-MM-DD at HH.MM.SS@2x.{png,mp4}`. "My latest screenshot" → check that dir sorted by mtime.

**Auto-organize**: When the user provides a screenshot from `~/Pictures/Screenshots/` root (not a subdirectory), move it to `~/Pictures/Screenshots/claude/` before reading.
