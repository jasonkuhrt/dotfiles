HOOKS
     tmux allows commands to run on various triggers, called hooks.  Most tmux
     commands have an after hook and there are a number of hooks not
     associated with commands.

     Hooks are stored as array options, members of the array are executed in
     order when the hook is triggered.	Like options different hooks may be
     global or belong to a session, window or pane.  Hooks may be configured
     with the set-hook or set-option commands and displayed with show-hooks or
     show-options -H.  The following two commands are equivalent:

	    set-hook -g pane-mode-changed[42] 'set -g status-left-style bg=red'
	    set-option -g pane-mode-changed[42] 'set -g status-left-style bg=red'

     Setting a hook without specifying an array index clears the hook and sets
     the first member of the array.

     A command's after hook is run after it completes, except when the command
     is run as part of a hook itself.  They are named with an ‘after-’ prefix.
     For example, the following command adds a hook to select the even-
     vertical layout after every split-window:

	   set-hook -g after-split-window "selectl even-vertical"

     If a command fails, the ‘command-error’ hook will be fired.  For example,
     this could be used to write to a log file:

	   set-hook -g command-error "run-shell \"echo 'a tmux command failed' >>/tmp/log\""

     All the notifications listed in the CONTROL MODE section are hooks
     (without any arguments), except %exit.  The following additional hooks
     are available:

     alert-activity	     Run when a window has activity.  See
			     monitor-activity.

     alert-bell 	     Run when a window has received a bell.  See
			     monitor-bell.

     alert-silence	     Run when a window has been silent.  See
			     monitor-silence.

     client-active	     Run when a client becomes the latest active
			     client of its session.

     client-attached	     Run when a client is attached.

     client-detached	     Run when a client is detached

     client-focus-in	     Run when focus enters a client

     client-focus-out	     Run when focus exits a client

     client-resized	     Run when a client is resized.

     client-session-changed  Run when a client's attached session is changed.

     client-light-theme      Run when a client switches to a light theme.

     client-dark-theme	     Run when a client switches to a dark theme.

     command-error	     Run when a command fails.

     pane-died		     Run when the program running in a pane exits, but
			     remain-on-exit is on so the pane has not closed.

     pane-exited	     Run when the program running in a pane exits.

     pane-focus-in	     Run when the focus enters a pane, if the
			     focus-events option is on.

     pane-focus-out	     Run when the focus exits a pane, if the
			     focus-events option is on.

     pane-set-clipboard      Run when the terminal clipboard is set using the
			     xterm(1) escape sequence.

     session-created	     Run when a new session created.

     session-closed	     Run when a session closed.

     session-renamed	     Run when a session is renamed.

     window-layout-changed   Run when a window layout is changed.

     window-linked	     Run when a window is linked into a session.

     window-renamed	     Run when a window is renamed.

     window-resized	     Run when a window is resized.  This may be after
			     the client-resized hook is run.

     window-unlinked	     Run when a window is unlinked from a session.

     Hooks are managed with these commands:

     set-hook [-agpRuw] [-t target-pane] hook-name [command]
	     Without -R, sets (or with -u unsets) hook hook-name to command.
	     The flags are the same as for set-option.

	     With -R, run hook-name immediately.

     show-hooks [-gpw] [-t target-pane] [hook]
	     Shows hooks.  The flags are the same as for show-options.
