KEY BINDINGS
     tmux allows a command to be bound to most keys, with or without a prefix
     key.  When specifying keys, most represent themselves (for example ‘A’ to
     ‘Z’).  Ctrl keys may be prefixed with ‘C-’ or ‘^’, Shift keys with ‘S-’
     and Alt (meta) with ‘M-’.	In addition, the following special key names
     are accepted: Up, Down, Left, Right, BSpace, BTab, DC (Delete), End,
     Enter, Escape, F1 to F12, Home, IC (Insert), NPage/PageDown/PgDn,
     PPage/PageUp/PgUp, Space, and Tab.  Note that to bind the ‘"’ or ‘'’
     keys, quotation marks are necessary, for example:

	   bind-key '"' split-window
	   bind-key "'" new-window

     A command bound to the Any key will execute for all keys which do not
     have a more specific binding.

     Commands related to key bindings are as follows:

     bind-key [-nr] [-N note] [-T key-table] key [command [argument ...]]
		   (alias: bind)
	     Bind key key to command.  Keys are bound in a key table.  By
	     default (without -T), the key is bound in the prefix key table.
	     This table is used for keys pressed after the prefix key (for
	     example, by default ‘c’ is bound to new-window in the prefix
	     table, so ‘C-b c’ creates a new window).  The root table is used
	     for keys pressed without the prefix key: binding ‘c’ to
	     new-window in the root table (not recommended) means a plain ‘c’
	     will create a new window.	-n is an alias for -T root.  Keys may
	     also be bound in custom key tables and the switch-client -T
	     command used to switch to them from a key binding.  The -r flag
	     indicates this key may repeat, see the initial-repeat-time and
	     repeat-time options.  -N attaches a note to the key (shown with
	     list-keys -N), which can be cleared by passing an empty string.
	     The -r and -N flags can be used without command to alter an
	     existing binding.

	     To view the default bindings and possible commands, see the
	     list-keys command.

     list-keys [-1aN] [-P prefix-string] [-T key-table] [key]
		   (alias: lsk)
	     List key bindings.  There are two forms: the default lists keys
	     as bind-key commands; -N lists only keys with attached notes and
	     shows only the key and note for each key.

	     With the default form, all key tables are listed by default.  -T
	     lists only keys in key-table.

	     With the -N form, only keys in the root and prefix key tables are
	     listed by default; -T also lists only keys in key-table.  -P
	     specifies a prefix to print before each key and -1 lists only the
	     first matching key.  -a lists the command for keys that do not
	     have a note rather than skipping them.

     send-keys [-FHKlMRX] [-c target-client] [-N repeat-count] [-t
	     target-pane] [key ...]
		   (alias: send)
	     Send a key or keys to a window or client.	Each argument key is
	     the name of the key (such as ‘C-a’ or ‘NPage’) to send; if the
	     string is not recognised as a key, it is sent as a series of
	     characters.  If -K is given, keys are sent to target-client, so
	     they are looked up in the client's key table, rather than to
	     target-pane.  All arguments are sent sequentially from first to
	     last.  If no keys are given and the command is bound to a key,
	     then that key is used.

	     The -l flag disables key name lookup and processes the keys as
	     literal UTF-8 characters.	The -H flag expects each key to be a
	     hexadecimal number for an ASCII character.

	     The -R flag causes the terminal state to be reset.

	     -M passes through a mouse event (only valid if bound to a mouse
	     key binding, see MOUSE SUPPORT).

	     -X is used to send a command into copy mode - see the WINDOWS AND
	     PANES section.  -N specifies a repeat count and -F expands
	     formats in arguments where appropriate.

     send-prefix [-2] [-t target-pane]
	     Send the prefix key, or with -2 the secondary prefix key, to a
	     window as if it was pressed.

     unbind-key [-anq] [-T key-table] key
		   (alias: unbind)
	     Unbind the command bound to key.  -n and -T are the same as for
	     bind-key.	If -a is present, all key bindings are removed.  The
	     -q option prevents errors being returned.
