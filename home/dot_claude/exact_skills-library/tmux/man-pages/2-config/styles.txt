STYLES
     tmux offers various options to specify the colour and attributes of
     aspects of the interface, for example status-style for the status line.
     In addition, embedded styles may be specified in format options, such as
     status-left, by enclosing them in ‘#[’ and ‘]’.

     A style may be the single term ‘default’ to specify the default style
     (which may come from an option, for example status-style in the status
     line) or a space or comma separated list of the following:

     fg=colour
	     Set the foreground colour.  The colour is one of: black, red,
	     green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white; if supported the
	     bright variants brightblack, brightred, ...; colour0 to colour255
	     from the 256-colour set; default for the default colour; terminal
	     for the terminal default colour; or a hexadecimal RGB string such
	     as ‘#ffffff’.

     bg=colour
	     Set the background colour.

     us=colour
	     Set the underscore colour.

     none    Set no attributes (turn off any active attributes).

     acs, bright (or bold), dim, underscore, blink, reverse, hidden, italics,
	     overline, strikethrough, double-underscore, curly-underscore,
	     dotted-underscore, dashed-underscore
	     Set an attribute.	Any of the attributes may be prefixed with
	     ‘no’ to unset.  acs is the terminal alternate character set.

     align=left (or noalign), align=centre, align=right
	     Align text to the left, centre or right of the available space if
	     appropriate.

     fill=colour
	     Fill the available space with a background colour if appropriate.

     list=on, list=focus, list=left-marker, list=right-marker, nolist
	     Mark the position of the various window list components in the
	     status-format option: list=on marks the start of the list;
	     list=focus is the part of the list that should be kept in focus
	     if the entire list won't fit in the available space (typically
	     the current window); list=left-marker and list=right-marker mark
	     the text to be used to mark that text has been trimmed from the
	     left or right of the list if there is not enough space.

     noattr  Do not copy attributes from the default style.

     push-default, pop-default
	     Store the current colours and attributes as the default or reset
	     to the previous default.  A push-default affects any subsequent
	     use of the default term until a pop-default.  Only one default
	     may be pushed (each push-default replaces the previous saved
	     default).

     range=left, range=right, range=session|X, range=window|X, range=pane|X,
	     range=user|X, norange
	     Mark a range for mouse events in the status-format option.  When
	     a mouse event occurs in the range=left or range=right range, the
	     ‘StatusLeft’ and ‘StatusRight’ key bindings are triggered.

	     range=session|X, range=window|X and range=pane|X are ranges for a
	     session, window or pane.  These trigger the ‘Status’ mouse key
	     with the target session, window or pane given by the ‘X’
	     argument.	‘X’ is a session ID, window index in the current
	     session or a pane ID.  For these, the mouse_status_range format
	     variable will be set to ‘session’, ‘window’ or ‘pane’.

	     range=user|X is a user-defined range; it triggers the ‘Status’
	     mouse key.  The argument ‘X’ will be available in the
	     mouse_status_range format variable.  ‘X’ must be at most 15 bytes
	     in length.

     set-default
	     Set the current colours and attributes as the default,
	     overwriting any previous default.	The previous default cannot be
	     restored.

     Examples are:

	   fg=yellow bold underscore blink
	   bg=black,fg=default,noreverse
