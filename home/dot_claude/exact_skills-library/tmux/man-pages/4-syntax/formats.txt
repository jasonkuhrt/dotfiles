FORMATS
     Certain commands accept the -F flag with a format argument.  This is a
     string which controls the output format of the command.  Format variables
     are enclosed in ‘#{’ and ‘}’, for example ‘#{session_name}’.  The
     possible variables are listed in the table below, or the name of a tmux
     option may be used for an option's value, or the name of an environment
     variable.	Some variables have a shorter alias such as ‘#S’; ‘##’ is
     replaced by a single ‘#’, ‘#,’ by a ‘,’ and ‘#}’ by a ‘}’.

     Conditionals are available by prefixing with ‘?’.	For each pair of two
     arguments, if the variable in the first of the pair exists and is not
     zero, the second of the pair is chosen, otherwise it continues.  If no
     condition from paired arguments matches, the default value is chosen.  If
     there's an unpaired final argument, that is the default.  If not, the
     default is the empty string.  For example
     ‘#{?session_attached,attached,not attached}’ will include the string
     ‘attached’ if the session is attached and the string ‘not attached’ if it
     is unattached, or ‘#{?automatic-rename,yes,no}’ will include ‘yes’ if
     automatic-rename is enabled, or ‘no’ if not.
     ‘#{?#{n:window_name},#{window_name} - }’ will include the window name
     with a dash separator if there is a window name, or the empty string if
     the window name is empty.
     ‘#{?session_format,format1,window_format,format2,format3}’ will include
     format1 for a session format, format2 for a window format, or format3 for
     neither a session nor a window format.  Conditionals can be nested
     arbitrarily.  Inside a conditional, ‘,’ and ‘}’ must be escaped as ‘#,’
     and ‘#}’, unless they are part of a ‘#{...}’ replacement.	For example:

	   #{?pane_in_mode,#[fg=white#,bg=red],#[fg=red#,bg=white]}#W

     String comparisons may be expressed by prefixing two comma-separated
     alternatives by ‘==’, ‘!=’, ‘<’, ‘>’, ‘<=’ or ‘>=’ and a colon.  For
     example ‘#{==:#{host},myhost}’ will be replaced by ‘1’ if running on
     ‘myhost’, otherwise by ‘0’.  ‘||’ and ‘&&’ evaluate to true if any or all
     of the comma-separated alternatives are true, for example
     ‘#{||:#{pane_in_mode},#{alternate_on}}’.  ‘!’ evaluates to true if the
     value is false and vice versa, for example ‘#{!:#{pane_in_mode}}’.  ‘!!’
     converts a value to a canonical boolean form, 1 for true and 0 for false,
     for example ‘#{!!:non-empty string}’ evaluates to 1.

     An ‘m’ specifies a glob(7) pattern or regular expression comparison.  The
     first argument is the pattern and the second the string to compare.  An
     optional argument specifies flags: ‘r’ means the pattern is a regular
     expression instead of the default glob(7) pattern, and ‘i’ means to
     ignore case.  For example: ‘#{m:*foo*,#{host}}’ or ‘#{m/ri:^A,MYVAR}’.  A
     ‘C’ performs a search for a glob(7) pattern or regular expression in the
     pane content and evaluates to zero if not found, or a line number if
     found.  Like ‘m’, an ‘r’ flag means search for a regular expression and
     ‘i’ ignores case.	For example: ‘#{C/r:^Start}’

     Numeric operators may be performed by prefixing two comma-separated
     alternatives with an ‘e’ and an operator.	An optional ‘f’ flag may be
     given after the operator to use floating point numbers, otherwise
     integers are used.  This may be followed by a number giving the number of
     decimal places to use for the result.  The available operators are:
     addition ‘+’, subtraction ‘-’, multiplication ‘*’, division ‘/’, modulus
     ‘m’ or ‘%’ (note that ‘%’ must be escaped as ‘%%’ in formats which are
     also expanded by strftime(3)) and numeric comparison operators ‘==’,
     ‘!=’, ‘<’, ‘<=’, ‘>’ and ‘>=’.  For example, ‘#{e|*|f|4:5.5,3}’
     multiplies 5.5 by 3 for a result with four decimal places and
     ‘#{e|%%:7,3}’ returns the modulus of 7 and 3.  ‘a’ replaces a numeric
     argument by its ASCII equivalent, so ‘#{a:98}’ results in ‘b’.  ‘c’
     replaces a tmux colour by its six-digit hexadecimal RGB value.

     A limit may be placed on the length of the resultant string by prefixing
     it by an ‘=’, a number and a colon.  Positive numbers count from the
     start of the string and negative from the end, so ‘#{=5:pane_title}’ will
     include at most the first five characters of the pane title, or
     ‘#{=-5:pane_title}’ the last five characters.  A suffix or prefix may be
     given as a second argument - if provided then it is appended or prepended
     to the string if the length has been trimmed, for example
     ‘#{=/5/...:pane_title}’ will append ‘...’ if the pane title is more than
     five characters.  Similarly, ‘p’ pads the string to a given width, for
     example ‘#{p10:pane_title}’ will result in a width of at least 10
     characters.  A positive width pads on the left, a negative on the right.
     ‘n’ expands to the length of the variable and ‘w’ to its width when
     displayed, for example ‘#{n:window_name}’.  ‘R’ repeats the first
     argument by a number of times given by the second argument, so ‘#{R:a,3}’
     will result in ‘aaa’.

     Prefixing a time variable with ‘t:’ will convert it to a string, so if
     ‘#{window_activity}’ gives ‘1445765102’, ‘#{t:window_activity}’ gives
     ‘Sun Oct 25 09:25:02 2015’.  Adding ‘p (’ ‘`t/p`’) will use shorter but
     less accurate time format for times in the past.  A custom format may be
     given using an ‘f’ suffix (note that ‘%’ must be escaped as ‘%%’ if the
     format is separately being passed through strftime(3), for example in the
     status-left option): ‘#{t/f/%%H#:%%M:window_activity}’, see strftime(3).

     The ‘b:’ and ‘d:’ prefixes are basename(3) and dirname(3) of the variable
     respectively.  ‘q:’ will escape sh(1) special characters or with a ‘h’
     suffix, escape hash characters (so ‘#’ becomes ‘##’).  ‘E:’ will expand
     the format twice, for example ‘#{E:status-left}’ is the result of
     expanding the content of the status-left option rather than the option
     itself.  ‘T:’ is like ‘E:’ but also expands strftime(3) specifiers.
     ‘S:’, ‘W:’, ‘P:’ or ‘L:’ will loop over each session, window, pane or
     client and insert the format once for each.  ‘L:’, ‘S:’ and ‘W:’ can take
     an optional sort argument ‘/i’, ‘/n’, ‘/t’ to sort by index, name, or
     last activity time; additionally ‘/r’ to sort in reverse order.  ‘/r’ can
     also be used with ‘P:’ to reverse the sort order by pane index.  For
     example, ‘S/nr:’ to sort sessions by name in reverse order.  For each,
     two comma-separated formats may be given: the second is used for the
     current window, active pane, or active session.  For example, to get a
     list of windows formatted like the status line:

	   #{W:#{E:window-status-format} ,#{E:window-status-current-format} }

     ‘N:’ checks if a window (without any suffix or with the ‘w’ suffix) or a
     session (with the ‘s’ suffix) name exists, for example ‘`N/w:foo`’ is
     replaced with 1 if a window named ‘foo’ exists.

     A prefix of the form ‘s/foo/bar/:’ will substitute ‘foo’ with ‘bar’
     throughout.  The first argument may be an extended regular expression and
     a final argument may be ‘i’ to ignore case, for example ‘s/a(.)/\1x/i:’
     would change ‘abABab’ into ‘bxBxbx’.  A different delimiter character may
     also be used, to avoid collisions with literal slashes in the pattern.
     For example, ‘s|foo/|bar/|:’ will substitute ‘foo/’ with ‘bar/’
     throughout.

     Multiple modifiers may be separated with a semicolon (;) as in
     ‘#{T;=10:status-left}’, which limits the resulting strftime(3) -expanded
     string to at most 10 characters.

     In addition, the last line of a shell command's output may be inserted
     using ‘#()’.  For example, ‘#(uptime)’ will insert the system's uptime.
     When constructing formats, tmux does not wait for ‘#()’ commands to
     finish; instead, the previous result from running the same command is
     used, or a placeholder if the command has not been run before.  If the
     command hasn't exited, the most recent line of output will be used, but
     the status line will not be updated more than once a second.  Commands
     are executed using /bin/sh and with the tmux global environment set (see
     the GLOBAL AND SESSION ENVIRONMENT section).

     An ‘l’ specifies that a string should be interpreted literally and not
     expanded.	For example ‘#{l:#{?pane_in_mode,yes,no}}’ will be replaced by
     ‘#{?pane_in_mode,yes,no}’.
