MISCELLANEOUS
     Miscellaneous commands are as follows:

     clock-mode [-t target-pane]
	     Display a large clock.

     if-shell [-bF] [-t target-pane] shell-command command [command]
		   (alias: if)
	     Execute the first command if shell-command (run with /bin/sh)
	     returns success or the second command otherwise.  Before being
	     executed, shell-command is expanded using the rules specified in
	     the FORMATS section, including those relevant to target-pane.
	     With -b, shell-command is run in the background.

	     If -F is given, shell-command is not executed but considered
	     success if neither empty nor zero (after formats are expanded).

     lock-server
		   (alias: lock)
	     Lock each client individually by running the command specified by
	     the lock-command option.

     run-shell [-bCE] [-c start-directory] [-d delay] [-t target-pane]
	     [shell-command]
		   (alias: run)
	     Execute shell-command using /bin/sh or (with -C) a tmux command
	     in the background without creating a window.  Before being
	     executed, shell-command is expanded using the rules specified in
	     the FORMATS section.  With -b, the command is run in the
	     background.  -d waits for delay seconds before starting the
	     command.  -E redirects the command's stderr to stdout instead of
	     ignoring it.  If -c is given, the current working directory is
	     set to start-directory.  If -C is not given, any output to stdout
	     is displayed in view mode (in the pane specified by -t or the
	     current pane if omitted) after the command finishes.  If the
	     command fails, the exit status is also displayed.

     wait-for [-L | -S | -U] channel
		   (alias: wait)
	     When used without options, prevents the client from exiting until
	     woken using wait-for -S with the same channel.  When -L is used,
	     the channel is locked and any clients that try to lock the same
	     channel are made to wait until the channel is unlocked with
	     wait-for -U.
