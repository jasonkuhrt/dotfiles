TERMINFO EXTENSIONS
     tmux understands some unofficial extensions to terminfo(5).  It is not
     normally necessary to set these manually, instead the terminal-features
     option should be used.

     AX      An existing extension that tells tmux the terminal supports
	     default colours.

     Bidi    Tell tmux that the terminal supports the VTE bidirectional text
	     extensions.

     Cs, Cr  Set the cursor colour.  The first takes a single string argument
	     and is used to set the colour; the second takes no arguments and
	     restores the default cursor colour.  If set, a sequence such as
	     this may be used to change the cursor colour from inside tmux:

		   $ printf '\033]12;red\033\\'

	     The colour is an X(7) colour, see XParseColor(3).

     Cmg, Clmg, Dsmg, Enmg
	     Set, clear, disable or enable DECSLRM margins.  These are set
	     automatically if the terminal reports it is VT420 compatible.

     Dsbp, Enbp
	     Disable and enable bracketed paste.  These are set automatically
	     if the XT capability is present.

     Dseks, Eneks
	     Disable and enable extended keys.

     Dsfcs, Enfcs
	     Disable and enable focus reporting.  These are set automatically
	     if the XT capability is present.

     Hls     Set or clear a hyperlink annotation.

     Nobr    Tell tmux that the terminal does not use bright colors for bold
	     display.

     Rect    Tell tmux that the terminal supports rectangle operations.

     Smol    Enable the overline attribute.

     Smulx   Set a styled underscore.  The single parameter is one of: 0 for
	     no underscore, 1 for normal underscore, 2 for double underscore,
	     3 for curly underscore, 4 for dotted underscore and 5 for dashed
	     underscore.

     Setulc, Setulc1, ol
	     Set the underscore colour or reset to the default.  Setulc is for
	     RGB colours and Setulc1 for ANSI or 256 colours.  The Setulc
	     argument is (red * 65536) + (green * 256) + blue where each is
	     between 0 and 255.

     Ss, Se  Set or reset the cursor style.  If set, a sequence such as this
	     may be used to change the cursor to an underline:

		   $ printf '\033[4 q'

	     If Se is not set, Ss with argument 0 will be used to reset the
	     cursor style instead.

     Swd     Set the opening sequence for the working directory notification.
	     The sequence is terminated using the standard fsl capability.

     Sxl     Indicates that the terminal supports SIXEL.

     Sync    Start (parameter is 1) or end (parameter is 2) a synchronized
	     update.

     Tc      Indicate that the terminal supports the ‘direct colour’ RGB
	     escape sequence (for example, \e[38;2;255;255;255m).

	     If supported, this is used for the initialize colour escape
	     sequence (which may be enabled by adding the ‘initc’ and ‘ccc’
	     capabilities to the tmux terminfo(5) entry).

	     This is equivalent to the RGB terminfo(5) capability.

     Ms      Store the current buffer in the host terminal's selection
	     (clipboard).  See the set-clipboard option above and the xterm(1)
	     man page.

     XT      This is an existing extension capability that tmux uses to mean
	     that the terminal supports the xterm(1) title set sequences and
	     to automatically set some of the capabilities above.
