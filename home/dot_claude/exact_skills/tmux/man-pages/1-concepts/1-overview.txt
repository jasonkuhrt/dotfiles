NAME
     tmux – terminal multiplexer

SYNOPSIS
     tmux [-2CDhlNuVv] [-c shell-command] [-f file] [-L socket-name]
	  [-S socket-path] [-T features] [command [flags]]

DESCRIPTION
     tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be
     created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen.  tmux may be
     detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later
     reattached.

     When tmux is started, it creates a new session with a single window and
     displays it on screen.  A status line at the bottom of the screen shows
     information on the current session and is used to enter interactive
     commands.

     A session is a single collection of pseudo terminals under the management
     of tmux.  Each session has one or more windows linked to it.  A window
     occupies the entire screen and may be split into rectangular panes, each
     of which is a separate pseudo terminal (the pty(4) manual page documents
     the technical details of pseudo terminals).  Any number of tmux instances
     may connect to the same session, and any number of windows may be present
     in the same session.  Once all sessions are killed, tmux exits.

     Each session is persistent and will survive accidental disconnection
     (such as ssh(1) connection timeout) or intentional detaching (with the
     ‘C-b d’ key strokes).  tmux may be reattached using:

	   $ tmux attach

     In tmux, a session is displayed on screen by a client and all sessions
     are managed by a single server.  The server and each client are separate
     processes which communicate through a socket in /tmp.

     The options are as follows:

     -2 	   Force tmux to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.
		   This is equivalent to -T 256.

     -C 	   Start in control mode (see the CONTROL MODE section).
		   Given twice (-CC) disables echo.

     -c shell-command
		   Execute shell-command using the default shell.  If
		   necessary, the tmux server will be started to retrieve the
		   default-shell option.  This option is for compatibility
		   with sh(1) when tmux is used as a login shell.

     -D 	   Do not start the tmux server as a daemon.  This also turns
		   the exit-empty option off.  With -D, command may not be
		   specified.

     -f file	   Specify an alternative configuration file.  By default,
		   tmux loads the system configuration file from
		   /opt/homebrew/etc/tmux.conf, if present, then looks for a
		   user configuration file at ~/.tmux.conf or
		   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux/tmux.conf.

		   The configuration file is a set of tmux commands which are
		   executed in sequence when the server is first started.
		   tmux loads configuration files once when the server process
		   has started.  The source-file command may be used to load a
		   file later.

		   tmux shows any error messages from commands in
		   configuration files in the first session created, and
		   continues to process the rest of the configuration file.

     -h 	   Print usage information and exit.

     -L socket-name
		   tmux stores the server socket in a directory under
		   TMUX_TMPDIR or /tmp if it is unset.	The default socket is
		   named default.  This option allows a different socket name
		   to be specified, allowing several independent tmux servers
		   to be run.  Unlike -S a full path is not necessary: the
		   sockets are all created in a directory tmux-UID under the
		   directory given by TMUX_TMPDIR or in /tmp.  The tmux-UID
		   directory is created by tmux and must not be world
		   readable, writable or executable.

		   If the socket is accidentally removed, the SIGUSR1 signal
		   may be sent to the tmux server process to recreate it (note
		   that this will fail if any parent directories are missing).

     -l 	   Behave as a login shell.  This flag currently has no effect
		   and is for compatibility with other shells when using tmux
		   as a login shell.

     -N 	   Do not start the server even if the command would normally
		   do so (for example new-session or start-server).

     -S socket-path
		   Specify a full alternative path to the server socket.  If
		   -S is specified, the default socket directory is not used
		   and any -L flag is ignored.

     -T features   Set terminal features for the client.  This is a comma-
		   separated list of features.	See the terminal-features
		   option.

     -u 	   Write UTF-8 output to the terminal even if the first
		   environment variable of LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG that is
		   set does not contain "UTF-8" or "UTF8".

     -V 	   Report the tmux version.

     -v 	   Request verbose logging.  Log messages will be saved into
		   tmux-client-PID.log and tmux-server-PID.log files in the
		   current directory, where PID is the PID of the server or
		   client process.  If -v is specified twice, an additional
		   tmux-out-PID.log file is generated with a copy of
		   everything tmux writes to the terminal.

		   The SIGUSR2 signal may be sent to the tmux server process
		   to toggle logging between on (as if -v was given) and off.

     command [flags]
		   This specifies one of a set of commands used to control
		   tmux, as described in the following sections.  If no
		   commands are specified, the command in
		   default-client-command is assumed, which defaults to
		   new-session.

NAMES AND TITLES
     tmux distinguishes between names and titles.  Windows and sessions have
     names, which may be used to specify them in targets and are displayed in
     the status line and various lists: the name is the tmux identifier for a
     window or session.  Only panes have titles.  A pane's title is typically
     set by the program running inside the pane using an escape sequence (like
     it would set the xterm(1) window title in X(7)).  Windows themselves do
     not have titles - a window's title is the title of its active pane.  tmux
     itself may set the title of the terminal in which the client is running,
     see the set-titles option.

     A session's name is set with the new-session and rename-session commands.
     A window's name is set with one of:

     1.      A command argument (such as -n for new-window or new-session).

     2.      An escape sequence (if the allow-rename option is turned on):

		   $ printf '\033kWINDOW_NAME\033\\'

     3.      Automatic renaming, which sets the name to the active command in
	     the window's active pane.	See the automatic-rename option.

     When a pane is first created, its title is the hostname.  A pane's title
     can be set via the title setting escape sequence, for example:

	   $ printf '\033]2;My Title\033\\'

     It can also be modified with the select-pane -T command.
