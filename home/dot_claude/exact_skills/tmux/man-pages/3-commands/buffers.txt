BUFFERS
     tmux maintains a set of named paste buffers.  Each buffer may be either
     explicitly or automatically named.  Explicitly named buffers are named
     when created with the set-buffer or load-buffer commands, or by renaming
     an automatically named buffer with set-buffer -n.	Automatically named
     buffers are given a name such as ‘buffer0001’, ‘buffer0002’ and so on.
     When the buffer-limit option is reached, the oldest automatically named
     buffer is deleted.  Explicitly named buffers are not subject to
     buffer-limit and may be deleted with the delete-buffer command.

     Buffers may be added using copy-mode or the set-buffer and load-buffer
     commands, and pasted into a window using the paste-buffer command.  If a
     buffer command is used and no buffer is specified, the most recently
     added automatically named buffer is assumed.

     A configurable history buffer is also maintained for each window.	By
     default, up to 2000 lines are kept; this can be altered with the
     history-limit option (see the set-option command above).

     The buffer commands are as follows:

     choose-buffer [-NryZ] [-F format] [-f filter] [-K key-format] [-O
	     sort-order] [-t target-pane] [template]
	     Put a pane into buffer mode, where a buffer may be chosen
	     interactively from a list.  Each buffer is shown on one line.  A
	     shortcut key is shown on the left in brackets allowing for
	     immediate choice, or the list may be navigated and an item chosen
	     or otherwise manipulated using the keys below.  -Z zooms the
	     pane.  -y disables any confirmation prompts.  The following keys
	     may be used in buffer mode:

		   Key	  Function
		   Enter  Paste selected buffer
		   Up	  Select previous buffer
		   Down   Select next buffer
		   C-s	  Search by name or content
		   n	  Repeat last search forwards
		   N	  Repeat last search backwards
		   t	  Toggle if buffer is tagged
		   T	  Tag no buffers
		   C-t	  Tag all buffers
		   p	  Paste selected buffer
		   P	  Paste tagged buffers
		   d	  Delete selected buffer
		   D	  Delete tagged buffers
		   e	  Open the buffer in an editor
		   f	  Enter a format to filter items
		   O	  Change sort field
		   r	  Reverse sort order
		   v	  Toggle preview
		   q	  Exit mode

	     After a buffer is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the buffer name in
	     template and the result executed as a command.  If template is
	     not given, "paste-buffer -p -b '%%'" is used.

	     -O specifies the initial sort field: one of ‘time’ (creation),
	     ‘name’ or ‘size’.	-r reverses the sort order.  -f specifies an
	     initial filter: the filter is a format - if it evaluates to zero,
	     the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.	If a
	     filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  -F specifies
	     the format for each item in the list and -K a format for each
	     shortcut key; both are evaluated once for each line.  -N starts
	     without the preview.  This command works only if at least one
	     client is attached.

     clear-history [-H] [-t target-pane]
		   (alias: clearhist)
	     Remove and free the history for the specified pane.  -H also
	     removes all hyperlinks.

     delete-buffer [-b buffer-name]
		   (alias: deleteb)
	     Delete the buffer named buffer-name, or the most recently added
	     automatically named buffer if not specified.

     list-buffers [-F format] [-f filter]
		   (alias: lsb)
	     List the global buffers.  -F specifies the format of each line
	     and -f a filter.  Only buffers for which the filter is true are
	     shown.  See the FORMATS section.

     load-buffer [-w] [-b buffer-name] [-t target-client] path
		   (alias: loadb)
	     Load the contents of the specified paste buffer from path.  If -w
	     is given, the buffer is also sent to the clipboard for
	     target-client using the xterm(1) escape sequence, if possible.
	     If path is ‘-’, the contents are read from stdin.

     paste-buffer [-dpr] [-b buffer-name] [-s separator] [-t target-pane]
		   (alias: pasteb)
	     Insert the contents of a paste buffer into the specified pane.
	     If not specified, paste into the current one.  With -d, also
	     delete the paste buffer.  When output, any linefeed (LF)
	     characters in the paste buffer are replaced with a separator, by
	     default carriage return (CR).  A custom separator may be
	     specified using the -s flag.  The -r flag means to do no
	     replacement (equivalent to a separator of LF).  If -p is
	     specified, paste bracket control codes are inserted around the
	     buffer if the application has requested bracketed paste mode.

     save-buffer [-a] [-b buffer-name] path
		   (alias: saveb)
	     Save the contents of the specified paste buffer to path.  The -a
	     option appends to rather than overwriting the file.  If path is
	     ‘-’, the contents are written to stdout.

     set-buffer [-aw] [-b buffer-name] [-t target-client] [-n new-buffer-name]
	     data
		   (alias: setb)
	     Set the contents of the specified buffer to data.	If -w is
	     given, the buffer is also sent to the clipboard for target-client
	     using the xterm(1) escape sequence, if possible.  The -a option
	     appends to rather than overwriting the buffer.  The -n option
	     renames the buffer to new-buffer-name.

     show-buffer [-b buffer-name]
		   (alias: showb)
	     Display the contents of the specified buffer.
