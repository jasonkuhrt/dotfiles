CLIENTS AND SESSIONS
     The tmux server manages clients, sessions, windows and panes.  Clients
     are attached to sessions to interact with them, either when they are
     created with the new-session command, or later with the attach-session
     command.  Each session has one or more windows linked into it.  Windows
     may be linked to multiple sessions and are made up of one or more panes,
     each of which contains a pseudo terminal.	Commands for creating, linking
     and otherwise manipulating windows are covered in the WINDOWS AND PANES
     section.

     The following commands are available to manage clients and sessions:

     attach-session [-dErx] [-c working-directory] [-f flags] [-t
	     target-session]
		   (alias: attach)
	     If run from outside tmux, attach to target-session in the current
	     terminal.	target-session must already exist - to create a new
	     session, see the new-session command (with -A to create or
	     attach).  If used from inside, switch the currently attached
	     session to target-session.  If -d is specified, any other clients
	     attached to the session are detached.  If -x is given, send
	     SIGHUP to the parent process of the client as well as detaching
	     the client, typically causing it to exit.	-f sets a comma-
	     separated list of client flags.  The flags are:

	     active-pane
		     the client has an independent active pane

	     ignore-size
		     the client does not affect the size of other clients

	     no-detach-on-destroy
		     do not detach the client when the session it is attached
		     to is destroyed if there are any other sessions

	     no-output
		     the client does not receive pane output in control mode

	     pause-after=seconds
		     output is paused once the pane is seconds behind in
		     control mode

	     read-only
		     the client is read-only

	     wait-exit
		     wait for an empty line input before exiting in control
		     mode

	     A leading ‘!’ turns a flag off if the client is already attached.
	     -r is an alias for -f read-only,ignore-size.  When a client is
	     read-only, only keys bound to the detach-client or switch-client
	     commands have any effect.	A client with the active-pane flag
	     allows the active pane to be selected independently of the
	     window's active pane used by clients without the flag.  This only
	     affects the cursor position and commands issued from the client;
	     other features such as hooks and styles continue to use the
	     window's active pane.

	     If no server is started, attach-session will attempt to start it;
	     this will fail unless sessions are created in the configuration
	     file.

	     The target-session rules for attach-session are slightly
	     adjusted: if tmux needs to select the most recently used session,
	     it will prefer the most recently used unattached session.

	     -c will set the session working directory (used for new windows)
	     to working-directory.

	     If -E is used, the update-environment option will not be applied.

     detach-client [-aP] [-E shell-command] [-s target-session] [-t
	     target-client]
		   (alias: detach)
	     Detach the current client if bound to a key, the client specified
	     with -t, or all clients currently attached to the session
	     specified by -s.  The -a option kills all but the client given
	     with -t.  If -P is given, send SIGHUP to the parent process of
	     the client, typically causing it to exit.	With -E, run
	     shell-command to replace the client.

     has-session [-t target-session]
		   (alias: has)
	     Report an error and exit with 1 if the specified session does not
	     exist.  If it does exist, exit with 0.

     kill-server
	     Kill the tmux server and clients and destroy all sessions.

     kill-session [-aC] [-t target-session]
	     Destroy the given session, closing any windows linked to it and
	     no other sessions, and detaching all clients attached to it.  If
	     -a is given, all sessions but the specified one is killed.  The
	     -C flag clears alerts (bell, activity, or silence) in all windows
	     linked to the session.

     list-clients [-F format] [-f filter] [-t target-session]
		   (alias: lsc)
	     List all clients attached to the server.  -F specifies the format
	     of each line and -f a filter.  Only clients for which the filter
	     is true are shown.  See the FORMATS section.  If target-session
	     is specified, list only clients connected to that session.

     list-commands [-F format] [command]
		   (alias: lscm)
	     List the syntax of command or - if omitted - of all commands
	     supported by tmux.

     list-sessions [-F format] [-f filter]
		   (alias: ls)
	     List all sessions managed by the server.  -F specifies the format
	     of each line and -f a filter.  Only sessions for which the filter
	     is true are shown.  See the FORMATS section.

     lock-client [-t target-client]
		   (alias: lockc)
	     Lock target-client, see the lock-server command.

     lock-session [-t target-session]
		   (alias: locks)
	     Lock all clients attached to target-session.

     new-session [-AdDEPX] [-c start-directory] [-e environment] [-f flags]
	     [-F format] [-n window-name] [-s session-name] [-t group-name]
	     [-x width] [-y height] [shell-command [argument ...]]
		   (alias: new)
	     Create a new session with name session-name.

	     The new session is attached to the current terminal unless -d is
	     given.  window-name and shell-command are the name of and shell
	     command to execute in the initial window.	With -d, the initial
	     size comes from the global default-size option; -x and -y can be
	     used to specify a different size.	‘-’ uses the size of the
	     current client if any.  If -x or -y is given, the default-size
	     option is set for the session.  -f sets a comma-separated list of
	     client flags (see attach-session).

	     If run from a terminal, any termios(4) special characters are
	     saved and used for new windows in the new session.

	     The -A flag makes new-session behave like attach-session if
	     session-name already exists; if -A is given, -D behaves like -d
	     to attach-session, and -X behaves like -x to attach-session.

	     If -t is given, it specifies a session group.  Sessions in the
	     same group share the same set of windows - new windows are linked
	     to all sessions in the group and any windows closed removed from
	     all sessions.  The current and previous window and any session
	     options remain independent and any session in a group may be
	     killed without affecting the others.  The group-name argument may
	     be:

	     1.      the name of an existing group, in which case the new
		     session is added to that group;

	     2.      the name of an existing session - the new session is
		     added to the same group as that session, creating a new
		     group if necessary;

	     3.      the name for a new group containing only the new session.

	     -n and shell-command are invalid if -t is used.

	     The -P option prints information about the new session after it
	     has been created.	By default, it uses the format
	     ‘#{session_name}:’ but a different format may be specified with
	     -F.

	     If -E is used, the update-environment option will not be applied.
	     -e takes the form ‘VARIABLE=value’ and sets an environment
	     variable for the newly created session; it may be specified
	     multiple times.

     refresh-client [-cDLRSU] [-A pane:state] [-B name:what:format] [-C size]
	     [-f flags] [-l [target-pane]] [-r pane:report] [-t target-client]
	     [adjustment]
		   (alias: refresh)
	     Refresh the current client if bound to a key, or a single client
	     if one is given with -t.  If -S is specified, only update the
	     client's status line.

	     The -U, -D, -L -R, and -c flags allow the visible portion of a
	     window which is larger than the client to be changed.  -U moves
	     the visible part up by adjustment rows and -D down, -L left by
	     adjustment columns and -R right.  -c returns to tracking the
	     cursor automatically.  If adjustment is omitted, 1 is used.  Note
	     that the visible position is a property of the client not of the
	     window, changing the current window in the attached session will
	     reset it.

	     -C sets the width and height of a control mode client or of a
	     window for a control mode client, size must be one of
	     ‘widthxheight’ or ‘window ID:widthxheight’, for example ‘80x24’
	     or ‘@0:80x24’.  -A allows a control mode client to trigger
	     actions on a pane.  The argument is a pane ID (with leading ‘%’),
	     a colon, then one of ‘on’, ‘off’, ‘continue’ or ‘pause’.  If
	     ‘off’, tmux will not send output from the pane to the client and
	     if all clients have turned the pane off, will stop reading from
	     the pane.	If ‘continue’, tmux will return to sending output to
	     the pane if it was paused (manually or with the pause-after
	     flag).  If ‘pause’, tmux will pause the pane.  -A may be given
	     multiple times for different panes.

	     -B sets a subscription to a format for a control mode client.
	     The argument is split into three items by colons: name is a name
	     for the subscription; what is a type of item to subscribe to;
	     format is the format.  After a subscription is added, changes to
	     the format are reported with the %subscription-changed
	     notification, at most once a second.  If only the name is given,
	     the subscription is removed.  what may be empty to check the
	     format only for the attached session, or one of: a pane ID such
	     as ‘%0’; ‘%*’ for all panes in the attached session; a window ID
	     such as ‘@0’; or ‘@*’ for all windows in the attached session.

	     -f sets a comma-separated list of client flags, see
	     attach-session.  -r allows a control mode client to provide
	     information about a pane via a report (such as the response to
	     OSC 10).  The argument is a pane ID (with a leading ‘%’), a
	     colon, then a report escape sequence.

	     -l requests the clipboard from the client using the xterm(1)
	     escape sequence.  If target-pane is given, the clipboard is sent
	     (in encoded form), otherwise it is stored in a new paste buffer.

	     -L, -R, -U and -D move the visible portion of the window left,
	     right, up or down by adjustment, if the window is larger than the
	     client.  -c resets so that the position follows the cursor.  See
	     the window-size option.

     rename-session [-t target-session] new-name
		   (alias: rename)
	     Rename the session to new-name.

     server-access [-adlrw] [user]
	     Change the access or read/write permission of user.  The user
	     running the tmux server (its owner) and the root user cannot be
	     changed and are always permitted access.

	     -a and -d are used to give or revoke access for the specified
	     user.  If the user is already attached, the -d flag causes their
	     clients to be detached.

	     -r and -w change the permissions for user: -r makes their clients
	     read-only and -w writable.  -l lists current access permissions.

	     By default, the access list is empty and tmux creates sockets
	     with file system permissions preventing access by any user other
	     than the owner (and root).  These permissions must be changed
	     manually.	Great care should be taken not to allow access to
	     untrusted users even read-only.

     show-messages [-JT] [-t target-client]
		   (alias: showmsgs)
	     Show server messages or information.  Messages are stored, up to
	     a maximum of the limit set by the message-limit server option.
	     -J and -T show debugging information about jobs and terminals.

     source-file [-Fnqv] [-t target-pane] path ...
		   (alias: source)
	     Execute commands from one or more files specified by path (which
	     may be glob(7) patterns).	If -F is present, then path is
	     expanded as a format.  If -q is given, no error will be returned
	     if path does not exist.  With -n, the file is parsed but no
	     commands are executed.  -v shows the parsed commands and line
	     numbers if possible.

     start-server
		   (alias: start)
	     Start the tmux server, if not already running, without creating
	     any sessions.

	     Note that as by default the tmux server will exit with no
	     sessions, this is only useful if a session is created in
	     ~/.tmux.conf, exit-empty is turned off, or another command is run
	     as part of the same command sequence.  For example:

		   $ tmux start \; show -g

     suspend-client [-t target-client]
		   (alias: suspendc)
	     Suspend a client by sending SIGTSTP (tty stop).

     switch-client [-ElnprZ] [-c target-client] [-t target-session] [-T
	     key-table]
		   (alias: switchc)
	     Switch the current session for client target-client to
	     target-session.  As a special case, -t may refer to a pane (a
	     target that contains ‘:’, ‘.’ or ‘%’), to change session, window
	     and pane.	In that case, -Z keeps the window zoomed if it was
	     zoomed.  If -l, -n or -p is used, the client is moved to the
	     last, next or previous session respectively.  -r toggles the
	     client read-only and ignore-size flags (see the attach-session
	     command).

	     If -E is used, update-environment option will not be applied.

	     -T sets the client's key table; the next key from the client will
	     be interpreted from key-table.  This may be used to configure
	     multiple prefix keys, or to bind commands to sequences of keys.
	     For example, to make typing ‘abc’ run the list-keys command:

		   bind-key -Ttable2 c list-keys
		   bind-key -Ttable1 b switch-client -Ttable2
		   bind-key -Troot   a switch-client -Ttable1
