STATUS LINE
     tmux includes an optional status line which is displayed in the bottom
     line of each terminal.

     By default, the status line is enabled and one line in height (it may be
     disabled or made multiple lines with the status session option) and
     contains, from left-to-right: the name of the current session in square
     brackets; the window list; the title of the active pane in double quotes;
     and the time and date.

     Each line of the status line is configured with the status-format option.
     The default is made of three parts: configurable left and right sections
     (which may contain dynamic content such as the time or output from a
     shell command, see the status-left, status-left-length, status-right, and
     status-right-length options below), and a central window list.  By
     default, the window list shows the index, name and (if any) flag of the
     windows present in the current session in ascending numerical order.  It
     may be customised with the window-status-format and
     window-status-current-format options.  The flag is one of the following
     symbols appended to the window name:

	   Symbol    Meaning
	   *	     Denotes the current window.
	   -	     Marks the last window (previously selected).
	   #	     Window activity is monitored and activity has been
		     detected.
	   !	     Window bells are monitored and a bell has occurred in the
		     window.
	   ~	     The window has been silent for the monitor-silence
		     interval.
	   M	     The window contains the marked pane.
	   Z	     The window's active pane is zoomed.

     The # symbol relates to the monitor-activity window option.  The window
     name is printed in inverted colours if an alert (bell, activity or
     silence) is present.

     The colour and attributes of the status line may be configured, the
     entire status line using the status-style session option and individual
     windows using the window-status-style window option.

     The status line is automatically refreshed at interval if it has changed,
     the interval may be controlled with the status-interval session option.

     Commands related to the status line are as follows:

     clear-prompt-history [-T prompt-type]
		   (alias: clearphist)
	     Clear status prompt history for prompt type prompt-type.  If -T
	     is omitted, then clear history for all types.  See command-prompt
	     for possible values for prompt-type.

     command-prompt [-1bFiklN] [-I inputs] [-p prompts] [-t target-client] [-T
	     prompt-type] [template]
	     Open the command prompt in a client.  This may be used from
	     inside tmux to execute commands interactively.

	     If template is specified, it is used as the command.  With -F,
	     template is expanded as a format.

	     If -I is present, inputs is a comma-separated list of the initial
	     text for each prompt.  If -p is given, prompts is a comma-
	     separated list of prompts which are displayed in order; otherwise
	     a single prompt is displayed, constructed from template if it is
	     present, or ‘:’ if not.  -l disables splitting of inputs and
	     prompts at commas and treats them literally.

	     Before the command is executed, the first occurrence of the
	     string ‘%%’ and all occurrences of ‘%1’ are replaced by the
	     response to the first prompt, all ‘%2’ are replaced with the
	     response to the second prompt, and so on for further prompts.  Up
	     to nine prompt responses may be replaced (‘%1’ to ‘%9’).  ‘%%%’
	     is like ‘%%’ but any quotation marks are escaped.

	     -1 makes the prompt only accept one key press, in this case the
	     resulting input is a single character.  -k is like -1 but the key
	     press is translated to a key name.  -N makes the prompt only
	     accept numeric key presses.  -i executes the command every time
	     the prompt input changes instead of when the user exits the
	     command prompt.

	     -T tells tmux the prompt type.  This affects what completions are
	     offered when Tab is pressed.  Available types are: ‘command’,
	     ‘search’, ‘target’ and ‘window-target’.

	     The following keys have a special meaning in the command prompt,
	     depending on the value of the status-keys option:

		   Function				vi	  emacs
		   Cancel command prompt		q	  Escape
		   Delete from cursor to start of word		  C-w
		   Delete entire command		d	  C-u
		   Delete from cursor to end		D	  C-k
		   Execute command			Enter	  Enter
		   Get next command from history		  Down
		   Get previous command from history		  Up
		   Insert top paste buffer		p	  C-y
		   Look for completions 		Tab	  Tab
		   Move cursor left			h	  Left
		   Move cursor right			l	  Right
		   Move cursor to end			$	  C-e
		   Move cursor to next word		w	  M-f
		   Move cursor to previous word 	b	  M-b
		   Move cursor to start 		0	  C-a
		   Transpose characters 			  C-t

	     With -b, the prompt is shown in the background and the invoking
	     client does not exit until it is dismissed.

     confirm-before [-by] [-c confirm-key] [-p prompt] [-t target-client]
	     command
		   (alias: confirm)
	     Ask for confirmation before executing command.  If -p is given,
	     prompt is the prompt to display; otherwise a prompt is
	     constructed from command.	It may contain the special character
	     sequences supported by the status-left option.  With -b, the
	     prompt is shown in the background and the invoking client does
	     not exit until it is dismissed.  -y changes the default behaviour
	     (if Enter alone is pressed) of the prompt to run the command.  -c
	     changes the confirmation key to confirm-key; the default is ‘y’.

     display-menu [-OM] [-b border-lines] [-c target-client] [-C
	     starting-choice] [-H selected-style] [-s style] [-S border-style]
	     [-t target-pane] [-T title] [-x position] [-y position] name key
	     command [name key command ...]
		   (alias: menu)
	     Display a menu on target-client.  target-pane gives the target
	     for any commands run from the menu.

	     A menu is passed as a series of arguments: first the menu item
	     name, second the key shortcut (or empty for none) and third the
	     command to run when the menu item is chosen.  The name and
	     command are formats, see the FORMATS and STYLES sections.	If the
	     name begins with a hyphen (-), then the item is disabled (shown
	     dim) and may not be chosen.  The name may be empty for a
	     separator line, in which case both the key and command should be
	     omitted.

	     -b sets the type of characters used for drawing menu borders.
	     See popup-border-lines for possible values for border-lines.

	     -H sets the style for the selected menu item (see STYLES).

	     -s sets the style for the menu and -S sets the style for the menu
	     border (see STYLES).

	     -T is a format for the menu title (see FORMATS).

	     -C sets the menu item selected by default, if the menu is not
	     bound to a mouse key binding.

	     -x and -y give the position of the menu.  Both may be a row or
	     column number, or one of the following special values:

		   Value    Flag    Meaning
		   C	    Both    The centre of the terminal
		   R	    -x	    The right side of the terminal
		   P	    Both    The bottom left of the pane
		   M	    Both    The mouse position
		   W	    Both    The window position on the status line
		   S	    -y	    The line above or below the status line

	     Or a format, which is expanded including the following additional
	     variables:

		   Variable name		 Replaced with
		   popup_centre_x		 Centered in the client
		   popup_centre_y		 Centered in the client
		   popup_height 		 Height of menu or popup
		   popup_mouse_bottom		 Bottom of at the mouse
		   popup_mouse_centre_x 	 Horizontal centre at the
						 mouse
		   popup_mouse_centre_y 	 Vertical centre at the mouse
		   popup_mouse_top		 Top at the mouse
		   popup_mouse_x		 Mouse X position
		   popup_mouse_y		 Mouse Y position
		   popup_pane_bottom		 Bottom of the pane
		   popup_pane_left		 Left of the pane
		   popup_pane_right		 Right of the pane
		   popup_pane_top		 Top of the pane
		   popup_status_line_y		 Above or below the status
						 line
		   popup_width			 Width of menu or popup
		   popup_window_status_line_x	 At the window position in
						 status line
		   popup_window_status_line_y	 At the status line showing
						 the window

	     Each menu consists of items followed by a key shortcut shown in
	     brackets.	If the menu is too large to fit on the terminal, it is
	     not displayed.  Pressing the key shortcut chooses the
	     corresponding item.  If the mouse is enabled and the menu is
	     opened from a mouse key binding, releasing the mouse button with
	     an item selected chooses that item and releasing the mouse button
	     without an item selected closes the menu.	-O changes this
	     behaviour so that the menu does not close when the mouse button
	     is released without an item selected the menu is not closed and a
	     mouse button must be clicked to choose an item.

	     -M tells tmux the menu should handle mouse events; by default
	     only menus opened from mouse key bindings do so.

	     The following keys are available in menus:

		   Key	  Function
		   Enter  Choose selected item
		   Up	  Select previous item
		   Down   Select next item
		   q	  Exit menu

     display-message [-aCIlNpv] [-c target-client] [-d delay] [-t target-pane]
	     [message]
		   (alias: display)
	     Display a message.  If -p is given, the output is printed to
	     stdout, otherwise it is displayed in the target-client status
	     line for up to delay milliseconds.  If delay is not given, the
	     display-time option is used; a delay of zero waits for a key
	     press.  ‘N’ ignores key presses and closes only after the delay
	     expires.  If -C is given, the pane will continue to be updated
	     while the message is displayed.  If -l is given, message is
	     printed unchanged.  Otherwise, the format of message is described
	     in the FORMATS section; information is taken from target-pane if
	     -t is given, otherwise the active pane.

	     -v prints verbose logging as the format is parsed and -a lists
	     the format variables and their values.

	     -I forwards any input read from stdin to the empty pane given by
	     target-pane.

     display-popup [-BCEkN] [-b border-lines] [-c target-client] [-d
	     start-directory] [-e environment] [-h height] [-s style] [-S
	     border-style] [-t target-pane] [-T title] [-w width] [-x
	     position] [-y position] [shell-command [argument ...]]
		   (alias: popup)
	     Display a popup running shell-command (or default-command when
	     omitted) on target-client.  A popup is a rectangular box drawn
	     over the top of any panes.  Panes are not updated while a popup
	     is present.  If the command is run inside an existing popup, that
	     popup is modified.  Only the -b, -B, -C, -E, -EE, -K, -N, -s, and
	     -S options are accepted in this case; all others are ignored.

	     -E closes the popup automatically when shell-command exits.  Two
	     -E closes the popup only if shell-command exited with success.
	     -k allows any key to dismiss the popup instead of only ‘Escape’
	     or ‘C-c’.

	     -x and -y give the position of the popup, they have the same
	     meaning as for the display-menu command.  -w and -h give the
	     width and height - both may be a percentage (followed by ‘%’).
	     If omitted, half of the terminal size is used.

	     -B does not surround the popup by a border.

	     -b sets the type of characters used for drawing popup borders.
	     When -B is specified, the -b option is ignored.  See
	     popup-border-lines for possible values for border-lines.

	     -s sets the style for the popup and -S sets the style for the
	     popup border (see STYLES).

	     -e takes the form ‘VARIABLE=value’ and sets an environment
	     variable for the popup; it may be specified multiple times.

	     -T is a format for the popup title (see FORMATS).

	     The -C flag closes any popup on the client.

	     -N disables any previously specified -E, -EE, or -k option.

     show-prompt-history [-T prompt-type]
		   (alias: showphist)
	     Display status prompt history for prompt type prompt-type.  If -T
	     is omitted, then show history for all types.  See command-prompt
	     for possible values for prompt-type.
