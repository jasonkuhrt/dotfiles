WINDOWS AND PANES
     Each window displayed by tmux may be split into one or more panes; each
     pane takes up a certain area of the display and is a separate terminal.
     A window may be split into panes using the split-window command.  Windows
     may be split horizontally (with the -h flag) or vertically.  Panes may be
     resized with the resize-pane command (bound to ‘C-Up’, ‘C-Down’ ‘C-Left’
     and ‘C-Right’ by default), the current pane may be changed with the
     select-pane command and the rotate-window and swap-pane commands may be
     used to swap panes without changing their position.  Panes are numbered
     beginning from zero in the order they are created.

     By default, a tmux pane permits direct access to the terminal contained
     in the pane.  A pane may also be put into one of several modes:

	   -   Copy mode, which permits a section of a window or its history
	       to be copied to a paste buffer for later insertion into another
	       window.	This mode is entered with the copy-mode command, bound
	       to ‘[’ by default.  Copied text can be pasted with the
	       paste-buffer command, bound to ‘]’.

	   -   View mode, which is like copy mode but is entered when a
	       command that produces output, such as list-keys, is executed
	       from a key binding.

	   -   Choose mode, which allows an item to be chosen from a list.
	       This may be a client, a session or window or pane, or a buffer.
	       This mode is entered with the choose-buffer, choose-client and
	       choose-tree commands.

     In copy mode an indicator is displayed in the top-right corner of the
     pane with the current position and the number of lines in the history.

     Commands are sent to copy mode using the -X flag to the send-keys
     command.  When a key is pressed, copy mode automatically uses one of two
     key tables, depending on the mode-keys option: copy-mode for emacs, or
     copy-mode-vi for vi.  Key tables may be viewed with the list-keys
     command.

     The following commands are supported in copy mode:

	     Append the selection to the top paste buffer.

     append-selection-and-cancel (vi: A)
	     Append the selection to the top paste buffer and exit copy mode.

     top-line (vi: H) (emacs: M-R)
	     Move to the top line.

     The search commands come in several varieties: ‘search-forward’ and
     ‘search-backward’ search for a regular expression; the ‘-text’ variants
     search for a plain text string rather than a regular expression;
     ‘-incremental’ perform an incremental search and expect to be used with
     the -i flag to the command-prompt command.  ‘search-again’ repeats the
     last search and ‘search-reverse’ does the same but reverses the direction
     (forward becomes backward and backward becomes forward).

     The default incremental search key bindings, ‘C-r’ and ‘C-s’, are
     designed to emulate emacs(1).  When first pressed they allow a new search
     term to be entered; if pressed with an empty search term they repeat the
     previously used search term.

     The ‘next-prompt’ and ‘previous-prompt’ move between shell prompts, but
     require the shell to emit an escape sequence (\033]133;A\033\\) to tell
     tmux where the prompts are located; if the shell does not do this, these
     commands will do nothing.	The -o flag jumps to the beginning of the
     command output instead of the shell prompt.  Finding the beginning of
     command output requires the shell to emit an escape sequence
     (\033]133;C\033\\) to tell tmux where the output begins.  If the shell
     does not send these escape sequences, these commands do nothing.

     Copy commands may take an optional buffer prefix argument which is used
     to generate the buffer name (the default is ‘buffer’ so buffers are named
     ‘buffer0’, ‘buffer1’ and so on).  Pipe commands take a command argument
     which is the command to which the selected text is piped.	‘copy-pipe’
     variants also copy the selection.	The ‘-and-cancel’ variants of some
     commands exit copy mode after they have completed (for copy commands) or
     when the cursor reaches the bottom (for scrolling commands).  ‘-no-clear’
     variants do not clear the selection.  All the copy commands can take the
     -C and -P flags.  The -C flag suppresses setting the terminal clipboard
     when copying, while the -P flag suppresses adding a paste buffer with the
     text.

     The next and previous word keys skip over whitespace and treat
     consecutive runs of either word separators or other letters as words.
     Word separators can be customized with the word-separators session
     option.  Next word moves to the start of the next word, next word end to
     the end of the next word and previous word to the start of the previous
     word.  The three next and previous space keys work similarly but use a
     space alone as the word separator.  Setting word-separators to the empty
     string makes next/previous word equivalent to next/previous space.

     The jump commands enable quick movement within a line.  For instance,
     typing ‘f’ followed by ‘/’ will move the cursor to the next ‘/’ character
     on the current line.  A ‘;’ will then jump to the next occurrence.

     Commands in copy mode may be prefaced by an optional repeat count.  With
     vi key bindings, a prefix is entered using the number keys; with emacs,
     the Alt (meta) key and a number begins prefix entry.

     The synopsis for the copy-mode command is:

     copy-mode [-deHMqSu] [-s src-pane] [-t target-pane]
	     Enter copy mode.

	     -u enters copy mode and scrolls one page up and -d one page down.
	     -H hides the position indicator in the top right.	-q cancels
	     copy mode and any other modes.

	     -M begins a mouse drag (only valid if bound to a mouse key
	     binding, see MOUSE SUPPORT).  -S scrolls when bound to a mouse
	     drag event; for example, copy-mode -Se is bound to
	     MouseDrag1ScrollbarSlider by default.

	     -s copies from src-pane instead of target-pane.

	     -e specifies that scrolling to the bottom of the history (to the
	     visible screen) should exit copy mode.  While in copy mode,
	     pressing a key other than those used for scrolling will disable
	     this behaviour.  This is intended to allow fast scrolling through
	     a pane's history, for example with:

		   bind PageUp copy-mode -eu
		   bind PageDown copy-mode -ed

     A number of preset arrangements of panes are available, these are called
     layouts.  These may be selected with the select-layout command or cycled
     with next-layout (bound to ‘Space’ by default); once a layout is chosen,
     panes within it may be moved and resized as normal.

     The following layouts are supported:

     even-horizontal
	     Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the window.

     even-vertical
	     Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.

     main-horizontal
	     A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the
	     remaining panes are spread from left to right in the leftover
	     space at the bottom.  Use the main-pane-height window option to
	     specify the height of the top pane.

     main-horizontal-mirrored
	     The same as main-horizontal but mirrored so the main pane is at
	     the bottom of the window.

     main-vertical
	     A large (main) pane is shown on the left of the window and the
	     remaining panes are spread from top to bottom in the leftover
	     space on the right.  Use the main-pane-width window option to
	     specify the width of the left pane.

     main-vertical-mirrored
	     The same as main-vertical but mirrored so the main pane is on the
	     right of the window.

     tiled   Panes are spread out as evenly as possible over the window in
	     both rows and columns.

     In addition, select-layout may be used to apply a previously used layout
     - the list-windows command displays the layout of each window in a form
     suitable for use with select-layout.  For example:

	   $ tmux list-windows
	   0: ksh [159x48]
	       layout: bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}
	   $ tmux select-layout 'bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}'

     tmux automatically adjusts the size of the layout for the current window
     size.  Note that a layout cannot be applied to a window with more panes
     than that from which the layout was originally defined.

     Commands related to windows and panes are as follows:

     break-pane [-abdP] [-F format] [-n window-name] [-s src-pane] [-t
	     dst-window]
		   (alias: breakp)
	     Break src-pane off from its containing window to make it the only
	     pane in dst-window.  With -a or -b, the window is moved to the
	     next index after or before (existing windows are moved if
	     necessary).  If -d is given, the new window does not become the
	     current window.  The -P option prints information about the new
	     window after it has been created.	By default, it uses the format
	     ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}.#{pane_index}’ but a different
	     format may be specified with -F.

     capture-pane [-aepPqCJMN] [-b buffer-name] [-E end-line] [-S start-line]
	     [-t target-pane]
		   (alias: capturep)
	     Capture the contents of a pane.  If -p is given, the output goes
	     to stdout, otherwise to the buffer specified with -b or a new
	     buffer if omitted.  If -a is given, the alternate screen is used,
	     and the history is not accessible.  If no alternate screen
	     exists, an error will be returned unless -q is given.  Similarly,
	     if the pane is in a mode, -M uses the screen for the mode.  If -e
	     is given, the output includes escape sequences for text and
	     background attributes.  -C also escapes non-printable characters
	     as octal \xxx.  -T ignores trailing positions that do not contain
	     a character.  -N preserves trailing spaces at each line's end and
	     -J preserves trailing spaces and joins any wrapped lines; -J
	     implies -T.  -P captures only any output that the pane has
	     received that is the beginning of an as-yet incomplete escape
	     sequence.

	     -S and -E specify the starting and ending line numbers, zero is
	     the first line of the visible pane and negative numbers are lines
	     in the history.  ‘-’ to -S is the start of the history and to -E
	     the end of the visible pane.  The default is to capture only the
	     visible contents of the pane.

     choose-client [-NryZ] [-F format] [-f filter] [-K key-format] [-O
	     sort-order] [-t target-pane] [template]
	     Put a pane into client mode, allowing a client to be selected
	     interactively from a list.  Each client is shown on one line.  A
	     shortcut key is shown on the left in brackets allowing for
	     immediate choice, or the list may be navigated and an item chosen
	     or otherwise manipulated using the keys below.  -Z zooms the
	     pane.  -y disables any confirmation prompts.  The following keys
	     may be used in client mode:

		   Key	  Function
		   Enter  Choose selected client
		   Up	  Select previous client
		   Down   Select next client
		   C-s	  Search by name
		   n	  Repeat last search forwards
		   N	  Repeat last search backwards
		   t	  Toggle if client is tagged
		   T	  Tag no clients
		   C-t	  Tag all clients
		   d	  Detach selected client
		   D	  Detach tagged clients
		   x	  Detach and HUP selected client
		   X	  Detach and HUP tagged clients
		   z	  Suspend selected client
		   Z	  Suspend tagged clients
		   f	  Enter a format to filter items
		   O	  Change sort field
		   r	  Reverse sort order
		   v	  Toggle preview
		   q	  Exit mode

	     After a client is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the client name in
	     template and the result executed as a command.  If template is
	     not given, "detach-client -t '%%'" is used.

	     -O specifies the initial sort field: one of ‘name’, ‘size’,
	     ‘creation’ (time), or ‘activity’ (time).  -r reverses the sort
	     order.  -f specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format -
	     if it evaluates to zero, the item in the list is not shown,
	     otherwise it is shown.  If a filter would lead to an empty list,
	     it is ignored.  -F specifies the format for each item in the list
	     and -K a format for each shortcut key; both are evaluated once
	     for each line.  -N starts without the preview or if given twice
	     with the larger preview.  This command works only if at least one
	     client is attached.

     choose-tree [-GNrswyZ] [-F format] [-f filter] [-K key-format] [-O
	     sort-order] [-t target-pane] [template]
	     Put a pane into tree mode, where a session, window or pane may be
	     chosen interactively from a tree.	Each session, window or pane
	     is shown on one line.  A shortcut key is shown on the left in
	     brackets allowing for immediate choice, or the tree may be
	     navigated and an item chosen or otherwise manipulated using the
	     keys below.  -s starts with sessions collapsed and -w with
	     windows collapsed.  -Z zooms the pane.  -y disables any
	     confirmation prompts.  The following keys may be used in tree
	     mode:

		   Key	  Function
		   Enter  Choose selected item
		   Up	  Select previous item
		   Down   Select next item
		   S-Up   Swap the current window with the previous one
		   S-Down Swap the current window with the next one
		   +	  Expand selected item
		   -	  Collapse selected item
		   M-+	  Expand all items
		   M--	  Collapse all items
		   x	  Kill selected item
		   X	  Kill tagged items
		   <	  Scroll list of previews left
		   >	  Scroll list of previews right
		   C-s	  Search by name
		   m	  Set the marked pane
		   M	  Clear the marked pane
		   n	  Repeat last search forwards
		   N	  Repeat last search backwards
		   t	  Toggle if item is tagged
		   T	  Tag no items
		   C-t	  Tag all items
		   :	  Run a command for each tagged item
		   f	  Enter a format to filter items
		   H	  Jump to the starting pane
		   O	  Change sort field
		   r	  Reverse sort order
		   v	  Toggle preview
		   q	  Exit mode

	     After a session, window or pane is chosen, the first instance of
	     ‘%%’ and all instances of ‘%1’ are replaced by the target in
	     template and the result executed as a command.  If template is
	     not given, "switch-client -t '%%'" is used.

	     -O specifies the initial sort field: one of ‘index’, ‘name’, or
	     ‘time’ (activity).  -r reverses the sort order.  -f specifies an
	     initial filter: the filter is a format - if it evaluates to zero,
	     the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.	If a
	     filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  -F specifies
	     the format for each item in the tree and -K a format for each
	     shortcut key; both are evaluated once for each line.  -N starts
	     without the preview or if given twice with the larger preview.
	     -G includes all sessions in any session groups in the tree rather
	     than only the first.  This command works only if at least one
	     client is attached.

     customize-mode [-NZ] [-F format] [-f filter] [-t target-pane] [template]
	     Put a pane into customize mode, where options and key bindings
	     may be browsed and modified from a list.  Option values in the
	     list are shown for the active pane in the current window.	-Z
	     zooms the pane.  The following keys may be used in customize
	     mode:

		   Key	  Function
		   Enter  Set pane, window, session or global option value
		   Up	  Select previous item
		   Down   Select next item
		   +	  Expand selected item
		   -	  Collapse selected item
		   M-+	  Expand all items
		   M--	  Collapse all items
		   s	  Set option value or key attribute
		   S	  Set global option value
		   w	  Set window option value, if option is for pane and
			  window
		   d	  Set an option or key to the default
		   D	  Set tagged options and tagged keys to the default
		   u	  Unset an option (set to default value if global) or
			  unbind a key
		   U	  Unset tagged options and unbind tagged keys
		   C-s	  Search by name
		   n	  Repeat last search forwards
		   N	  Repeat last search backwards
		   t	  Toggle if item is tagged
		   T	  Tag no items
		   C-t	  Tag all items
		   f	  Enter a format to filter items
		   v	  Toggle option information
		   q	  Exit mode

	     -f specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it
	     evaluates to zero, the item in the list is not shown, otherwise
	     it is shown.  If a filter would lead to an empty list, it is
	     ignored.  -F specifies the format for each item in the tree.  -N
	     starts without the option information.  This command works only
	     if at least one client is attached.

     display-panes [-bN] [-d duration] [-t target-client] [template]
		   (alias: displayp)
	     Display a visible indicator of each pane shown by target-client.
	     See the display-panes-colour and display-panes-active-colour
	     session options.  The indicator is closed when a key is pressed
	     (unless -N is given) or duration milliseconds have passed.  If -d
	     is not given, display-panes-time is used.	A duration of zero
	     means the indicator stays until a key is pressed.	While the
	     indicator is on screen, a pane may be chosen with the ‘0’ to ‘9’
	     keys, which will cause template to be executed as a command with
	     ‘%%’ substituted by the pane ID.  The default template is
	     "select-pane -t '%%'".  With -b, other commands are not blocked
	     from running until the indicator is closed.

     find-window [-iCNrTZ] [-t target-pane] match-string
		   (alias: findw)
	     Search for a glob(7) pattern or, with -r, regular expression
	     match-string in window names, titles, and visible content (but
	     not history).  The flags control matching behavior: -C matches
	     only visible window contents, -N matches only the window name and
	     -T matches only the window title.	-i makes the search ignore
	     case.  The default is -CNT.  -Z zooms the pane.

	     This command works only if at least one client is attached.

     join-pane [-bdfhv] [-l size] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
		   (alias: joinp)
	     Like split-window, but instead of splitting dst-pane and creating
	     a new pane, split it and move src-pane into the space.  This can
	     be used to reverse break-pane.  The -b option causes src-pane to
	     be joined to left of or above dst-pane.

	     If -s is omitted and a marked pane is present (see select-pane
	     -m), the marked pane is used rather than the current pane.

     kill-pane [-a] [-t target-pane]
		   (alias: killp)
	     Destroy the given pane.  If no panes remain in the containing
	     window, it is also destroyed.  The -a option kills all but the
	     pane given with -t.

     kill-window [-a] [-t target-window]
		   (alias: killw)
	     Kill the current window or the window at target-window, removing
	     it from any sessions to which it is linked.  The -a option kills
	     all but the window given with -t.

     last-pane [-deZ] [-t target-window]
		   (alias: lastp)
	     Select the last (previously selected) pane.  -Z keeps the window
	     zoomed if it was zoomed.  -e enables or -d disables input to the
	     pane.

     last-window [-t target-session]
		   (alias: last)
	     Select the last (previously selected) window.  If no
	     target-session is specified, select the last window of the
	     current session.

     link-window [-abdk] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
		   (alias: linkw)
	     Link the window at src-window to the specified dst-window.  If
	     dst-window is specified and no such window exists, the src-window
	     is linked there.  With -a or -b the window is moved to the next
	     index after or before dst-window (existing windows are moved if
	     necessary).  If -k is given and dst-window exists, it is killed,
	     otherwise an error is generated.  If -d is given, the newly
	     linked window is not selected.

     list-panes [-as] [-F format] [-f filter] [-t target]
		   (alias: lsp)
	     If -a is given, target is ignored and all panes on the server are
	     listed.  If -s is given, target is a session (or the current
	     session).	If neither is given, target is a window (or the
	     current window).  -F specifies the format of each line and -f a
	     filter.  Only panes for which the filter is true are shown.  See
	     the FORMATS section.

     list-windows [-a] [-F format] [-f filter] [-t target-session]
		   (alias: lsw)
	     If -a is given, list all windows on the server.  Otherwise, list
	     windows in the current session or in target-session.  -F
	     specifies the format of each line and -f a filter.  Only windows
	     for which the filter is true are shown.  See the FORMATS section.

     move-pane [-bdfhv] [-l size] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
		   (alias: movep)
	     Does the same as join-pane.

     move-window [-abrdk] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
		   (alias: movew)
	     This is similar to link-window, except the window at src-window
	     is moved to dst-window.  With -r, all windows in the session are
	     renumbered in sequential order, respecting the base-index option.

     new-window [-abdkPS] [-c start-directory] [-e environment] [-F format]
	     [-n window-name] [-t target-window] [shell-command [argument
	     ...]]
		   (alias: neww)
	     Create a new window.  With -a or -b, the new window is inserted
	     at the next index after or before the specified target-window,
	     moving windows up if necessary; otherwise target-window is the
	     new window location.

	     If -d is given, the session does not make the new window the
	     current window.  target-window represents the window to be
	     created; if the target already exists an error is shown, unless
	     the -k flag is used, in which case it is destroyed.  If -S is
	     given and a window named window-name already exists, it is
	     selected (unless -d is also given in which case the command does
	     nothing).

	     shell-command is the command to execute.  If shell-command is not
	     specified, the value of the default-command option is used.  -c
	     specifies the working directory in which the new window is
	     created.

	     When the shell command completes, the window closes.  See the
	     remain-on-exit option to change this behaviour.

	     -e takes the form ‘VARIABLE=value’ and sets an environment
	     variable for the newly created window; it may be specified
	     multiple times.

	     The TERM environment variable must be set to ‘screen’ or ‘tmux’
	     for all programs running inside tmux.  New windows will
	     automatically have ‘TERM=screen’ added to their environment, but
	     care must be taken not to reset this in shell start-up files or
	     by the -e option.

	     The -P option prints information about the new window after it
	     has been created.	By default, it uses the format
	     ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}’ but a different format may be
	     specified with -F.

     next-layout [-t target-window]
		   (alias: nextl)
	     Move a window to the next layout and rearrange the panes to fit.

     next-window [-a] [-t target-session]
		   (alias: next)
	     Move to the next window in the session.  If -a is used, move to
	     the next window with an alert.

     pipe-pane [-IOo] [-t target-pane] [shell-command]
		   (alias: pipep)
	     Pipe output sent by the program in target-pane to a shell command
	     or vice versa.  A pane may only be connected to one command at a
	     time, any existing pipe is closed before shell-command is
	     executed.	The shell-command string may contain the special
	     character sequences supported by the status-left option.  If no
	     shell-command is given, the current pipe (if any) is closed.

	     -I and -O specify which of the shell-command output streams are
	     connected to the pane: with -I stdout is connected (so anything
	     shell-command prints is written to the pane as if it were typed);
	     with -O stdin is connected (so any output in the pane is piped to
	     shell-command).  Both may be used together and if neither are
	     specified, -O is used.

	     The -o option only opens a new pipe if no previous pipe exists,
	     allowing a pipe to be toggled with a single key, for example:

		   bind-key C-p pipe-pane -o 'cat >>~/output.#I-#P'

     previous-layout [-t target-window]
		   (alias: prevl)
	     Move to the previous layout in the session.

     previous-window [-a] [-t target-session]
		   (alias: prev)
	     Move to the previous window in the session.  With -a, move to the
	     previous window with an alert.

     rename-window [-t target-window] new-name
		   (alias: renamew)
	     Rename the current window, or the window at target-window if
	     specified, to new-name.

     resize-pane [-DLMRTUZ] [-t target-pane] [-x width] [-y height]
	     [adjustment]
		   (alias: resizep)
	     Resize a pane, up, down, left or right by adjustment with -U, -D,
	     -L or -R, or to an absolute size with -x or -y.  The adjustment
	     is given in lines or columns (the default is 1); -x and -y may be
	     a given as a number of lines or columns or followed by ‘%’ for a
	     percentage of the window size (for example ‘-x 10%’).  With -Z,
	     the active pane is toggled between zoomed (occupying the whole of
	     the window) and unzoomed (its normal position in the layout).

	     -M begins mouse resizing (only valid if bound to a mouse key
	     binding, see MOUSE SUPPORT).

	     -T trims all lines below the current cursor position and moves
	     lines out of the history to replace them.

     resize-window [-aADLRU] [-t target-window] [-x width] [-y height]
	     [adjustment]
		   (alias: resizew)
	     Resize a window, up, down, left or right by adjustment with -U,
	     -D, -L or -R, or to an absolute size with -x or -y.  The
	     adjustment is given in lines or cells (the default is 1).	-A
	     sets the size of the largest session containing the window; -a
	     the size of the smallest.	This command will automatically set
	     window-size to manual in the window options.

     respawn-pane [-k] [-c start-directory] [-e environment] [-t target-pane]
	     [shell-command [argument ...]]
		   (alias: respawnp)
	     Reactivate a pane in which the command has exited (see the
	     remain-on-exit window option).  If shell-command is not given,
	     the command used when the pane was created or last respawned is
	     executed.	The pane must be already inactive, unless -k is given,
	     in which case any existing command is killed.  -c specifies a new
	     working directory for the pane.  The -e option has the same
	     meaning as for the new-window command.

     respawn-window [-k] [-c start-directory] [-e environment] [-t
	     target-window] [shell-command [argument ...]]
		   (alias: respawnw)
	     Reactivate a window in which the command has exited (see the
	     remain-on-exit window option).  If shell-command is not given,
	     the command used when the window was created or last respawned is
	     executed.	The window must be already inactive, unless -k is
	     given, in which case any existing command is killed.  -c
	     specifies a new working directory for the window.	The -e option
	     has the same meaning as for the new-window command.

     rotate-window [-DUZ] [-t target-window]
		   (alias: rotatew)
	     Rotate the positions of the panes within a window, either upward
	     (numerically lower) with -U or downward (numerically higher).  -Z
	     keeps the window zoomed if it was zoomed.

     select-layout [-Enop] [-t target-pane] [layout-name]
		   (alias: selectl)
	     Choose a specific layout for a window.  If layout-name is not
	     given, the last preset layout used (if any) is reapplied.	-n and
	     -p are equivalent to the next-layout and previous-layout
	     commands.	-o applies the last set layout if possible (undoes the
	     most recent layout change).  -E spreads the current pane and any
	     panes next to it out evenly.

     select-pane [-DdeLlMmRUZ] [-T title] [-t target-pane]
		   (alias: selectp)
	     Make pane target-pane the active pane in its window.  If one of
	     -D, -L, -R, or -U is used, respectively the pane below, to the
	     left, to the right, or above the target pane is used.  -Z keeps
	     the window zoomed if it was zoomed.  -l is the same as using the
	     last-pane command.  -e enables or -d disables input to the pane.
	     -T sets the pane title.

	     -m and -M are used to set and clear the marked pane.  There is
	     one marked pane at a time, setting a new marked pane clears the
	     last.  The marked pane is the default target for -s to join-pane,
	     move-pane, swap-pane and swap-window.

     select-window [-lnpT] [-t target-window]
		   (alias: selectw)
	     Select the window at target-window.  -l, -n and -p are equivalent
	     to the last-window, next-window and previous-window commands.  If
	     -T is given and the selected window is already the current
	     window, the command behaves like last-window.

     split-window [-bdfhIvPZ] [-c start-directory] [-e environment] [-F
	     format] [-l size] [-t target-pane] [shell-command [argument ...]]
		   (alias: splitw)
	     Create a new pane by splitting target-pane: -h does a horizontal
	     split and -v a vertical split; if neither is specified, -v is
	     assumed.  The -l option specifies the size of the new pane in
	     lines (for vertical split) or in columns (for horizontal split);
	     size may be followed by ‘%’ to specify a percentage of the
	     available space.  The -b option causes the new pane to be created
	     to the left of or above target-pane.  The -f option creates a new
	     pane spanning the full window height (with -h) or full window
	     width (with -v), instead of splitting the active pane.  -Z zooms
	     if the window is not zoomed, or keeps it zoomed if already
	     zoomed.

	     An empty shell-command ('') will create a pane with no command
	     running in it.  Output can be sent to such a pane with the
	     display-message command.  The -I flag (if shell-command is not
	     specified or empty) will create an empty pane and forward any
	     output from stdin to it.  For example:

		   $ make 2>&1|tmux splitw -dI &

	     All other options have the same meaning as for the new-window
	     command.

     swap-pane [-dDUZ] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
		   (alias: swapp)
	     Swap two panes.  If -U is used and no source pane is specified
	     with -s, dst-pane is swapped with the previous pane (before it
	     numerically); -D swaps with the next pane (after it numerically).
	     -d instructs tmux not to change the active pane and -Z keeps the
	     window zoomed if it was zoomed.

	     If -s is omitted and a marked pane is present (see select-pane
	     -m), the marked pane is used rather than the current pane.

     swap-window [-d] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
		   (alias: swapw)
	     This is similar to link-window, except the source and destination
	     windows are swapped.  It is an error if no window exists at
	     src-window.  If -d is given, the new window does not become the
	     current window.

	     If -s is omitted and a marked pane is present (see select-pane
	     -m), the window containing the marked pane is used rather than
	     the current window.

     unlink-window [-k] [-t target-window]
		   (alias: unlinkw)
	     Unlink target-window.  Unless -k is given, a window may be
	     unlinked only if it is linked to multiple sessions - windows may
	     not be linked to no sessions; if -k is specified and the window
	     is linked to only one session, it is unlinked and destroyed.
