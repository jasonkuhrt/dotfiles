GLOBAL AND SESSION ENVIRONMENT
     When the server is started, tmux copies the environment into the global
     environment; in addition, each session has a session environment.	When a
     window is created, the session and global environments are merged.  If a
     variable exists in both, the value from the session environment is used.
     The result is the initial environment passed to the new process.

     The update-environment session option may be used to update the session
     environment from the client when a new session is created or an old
     reattached.  tmux also initialises the TMUX variable with some internal
     information to allow commands to be executed from inside, and the TERM
     variable with the correct terminal setting of ‘screen’.

     Variables in both session and global environments may be marked as
     hidden.  Hidden variables are not passed into the environment of new
     processes and instead can only be used by tmux itself (for example in
     formats, see the FORMATS section).

     Commands to alter and view the environment are:

     set-environment [-Fhgru] [-t target-session] variable [value]
		   (alias: setenv)
	     Set or unset an environment variable.  If -g is used, the change
	     is made in the global environment; otherwise, it is applied to
	     the session environment for target-session.  If -F is present,
	     then value is expanded as a format.  The -u flag unsets a
	     variable.	-r indicates the variable is to be removed from the
	     environment before starting a new process.  -h marks the variable
	     as hidden.

     show-environment [-hgs] [-t target-session] [variable]
		   (alias: showenv)
	     Display the environment for target-session or the global
	     environment with -g.  If variable is omitted, all variables are
	     shown.  Variables removed from the environment are prefixed with
	     ‘-’.  If -s is used, the output is formatted as a set of Bourne
	     shell commands.  -h shows hidden variables (omitted by default).
