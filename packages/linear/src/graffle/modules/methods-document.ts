      /**
       * Build and execute type-safe native GraphQL documents.
       *
       * Accepts a document definition with multiple operations and returns
       * a document runner that can execute those operations with full type safety.
       *
       * # Usage
       *
       * Use the document method to build native GraphQL documents containing
       * one or more operations (queries, mutations, subscriptions). The returned
       * runner provides methods to execute each operation with inferred types.
       *
       * @example
       * ```ts
       * const doc = client.document({
       *   getPokemon: { query: { pokemon: { name: true } } },
       *   addPokemon: { mutation: { addPokemon: { $: { name: 'Pikachu' }, id: true } } }
       * })
       *
       * const result1 = await doc.run('getPokemon')
       * const result2 = await doc.run('addPokemon')
       * ```
